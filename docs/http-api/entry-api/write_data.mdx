# Entry API to Write Data

The API provides several endpoints for writing data to the database. The endpoints allow writing a single **[record](../../glossary#record)** or a batch of records in a single request.

## Write a Record to an Entry

ReductStore creates an **[entry](../../glossary#entry)** on the first write operation. The record
should be placed in the body of the HTTP request. The body can also be
empty.

The method needs a valid API token with write access to the entry's **[bucket](../../glossary#bucket)**
if authentication is enabled.

The endpoint can be used with the "Expect 100-continue" header. If the
header is not set and an error occurs on the database side, the database
drains the sent body and returns an HTTP status.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.3: the database supports labels. You can assign any number
  of labels to a record by using headers that start with
  `x-reduct-label-`.
- Version 1.18: returns `409 Conflict` if the bucket or entry is being deleted.

## Write a Batch of Records

This method allows multiple records to be written in a single request. A
client should describe the records in headers in the format of [the Batch Protocol](/docs/http-api/entry-api/index.mdx#batch-protocol).

**Changes**:

- Version 1.7: the database supports labels. You can assign any number
  of labels to a record by using headers that start with `x-reduct-label-`.
- Version 1.18: returns `409 Conflict` if the bucket or entry is being deleted.
