# Entry API to Write Data

The API provides several endpoints for writing data to the database. The endpoints allow writing a single record or a batch of records in a single request.

    <>
      ReductStore creates an entry on the first write operation. The record
      should be placed in the body of the HTTP request. The body can also be
      empty.
      <br />
      <br />
      The method needs a valid API token with write access to the entry's bucket
      if authentication is enabled.
      <br />
      <br />
      The endpoint can be used with the "Expect 100-continue" header. If the
      header is not set and an error occurs on the database side, the database
      drains the sent body and returns an HTTP status.
