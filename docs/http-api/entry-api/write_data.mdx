# Entry API to Write Data

The API provides several endpoints for writing data to the database. The endpoints allow writing a single record or a batch of records in a single request.

## Write a Record to an Entry

ReductStore creates an entry on the first write operation. The record
should be placed in the body of the HTTP request. The body can also be
empty.

The method needs a valid API token with write access to the entry's bucket
if authentication is enabled.

The endpoint can be used with the "Expect 100-continue" header. If the
header is not set and an error occurs on the database side, the database
drains the sent body and returns an HTTP status.

**Changes**:

* Version 1.3: the database supports labels. You can assign any number
  of labels to a record by using headers that start with
  `x-reduct-label-`.

## Write a Batch of Records

This method allows multiple records to be written in a single request. A
client should describe the records in headers in the format of [the Batch Protocol](/docs/http-api/entry-api/index.mdx#batch-protocol).

**Changes**:

* Version 1.7: the database supports labels. You can assign any number
  of labels to a record by using headers that start with `x-reduct-label-`.
