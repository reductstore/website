# Entry API Specification Reference

The Entry API allows users to read, write, update, and delete data from their buckets. It also provides query operations to search for specific entries.

The API uses the following types of endpoints each with its own purpose:

- **Single Record Endpoints** - CRUD requests for reading and writing a single **[record](../glossary#record)**. Which is simple and easy to use.
- **Batch Endpoints** - For reading and writing multiple records in a single request. It is more efficient for transferring large amounts of data.
- **Query Endpoints** - For querying data with filters and aggregations over a time range.

## Batch Protocol

To reduce HTTP overhead when sending many small objects, ReductStore provides a batch model for writing and reading data. The meta information about records is serialized in a CSV line in the headers, and the content of the records is sent in the body of an HTTP request or response.

The HTTP header format:

```
x-reduct-time-<TIME>: [CONTENT_SIZE],[CONTENT_TYPE],[LABEL-KEY1=LABEL-VALUE1],[LABEL-KEY2=LABEL-VALUE2],...
```

Where:

- `TIME` is the UNIX timestamp of the record in microseconds.
- `CONTENT_SIZE` is the size of the record content in bytes.
- `CONTENT_TYPE` is the MIME type of the record content.
- `LABEL-KEY1=LABEL-VALUE1` is the key-value pair of the record labels. If the value contains a comma, it should be enclosed in quotes.

Example of the HTTP headers:

```
x-reduct-time-1631540400000000: 1024,application/json,key1=value1,key2=value2,key3="[a,b,c]"
x-reduct-time-1631540400001000: 2048,application/json,key1=value1,key2=value2,key3="[a,b,c]"
```

The headers must be sorted by the timestamp in ascending order.

The content of the records is sent in the body of the HTTP request or response in the same order as the headers and concatenated without any separator.
A client should use the content size from the headers to read the record content from the body.

The response may contain a list of records which were not processed due to errors. The list is serialized in the `x-reduct-errors-<timestamp>` header in the following format:

```
x-reduct-errors-<TIMESTAMP>: <ERROR_CODE>,<ERROR_MESSAGE>
```

Where:

- `TIMESTAMP` is the UNIX timestamp of the record in microseconds.
- `ERROR_CODE` is the HTTP error code of the error.
- `ERROR_MESSAGE` is the error message.

:::info
Many HTTP clients have a limit on the size of the headers. If you are sending a large number of records, you may need to split the request into multiple smaller requests.
