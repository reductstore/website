# Entry API to Read Data

The API provides several endpoints for reading data from an entry including reading a single record, reading multiple records in a batch, and querying records for a time interval.

## Get a Record from an Entry

The method finds a record for the given timestamp or query ID and sends its content in
the HTTP response body. It also sends meta information in headers:

- `x-reduct-time` - UNIX timestamp of the record in microseconds
- `x-reduct-last` - 1 - if a record is the last record in the query (deprecated since version 1.4, use NoContent response)
- `x-reduct-label-<name>` - a value of the `<name>` label

If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read
access to the entry's bucket.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.3: the database supports labels. If a record has some
  labels, the method sends them as headers that start with `x-reduct-label`.
- Version 1.4: the `x-reduct-last` header is deprecated. Use the NoContent response instead.

## Get a Batch of Records from an Entry

The method retrieves a batch of records for the given query ID and sends their contents in the HTTP response
body.

The method works in conjunction with the `GET /b/:bucket/:entry/q` method and uses [the Batch Protocol](https://reduct.store/docs/http-api/entry-api/batch-protocol) to read records in a batch.

If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read access to the entry's bucket.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.5: the method was introduced.

        },
    ]}

/>

## Query Records for a Time Interval

The method responds with a JSON document containing an ID which should be
used to read records with the following endpoint: `GET /b/:bucket_name/:entry_name?q=ID.`

The time interval is [start, stop).

If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read
access to the bucket of the entry.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.3: the method also provides the `include-<label>` and `exclude-<label>` query parameters to filter records based on the values of certain labels.
  For example:
  ```
    GET /api/v1/:bucket/:entry/q?include-<label1>=foo&exclude-<label2>=bar
  ```
  This would find all records that have `label1` equal to "foo" and excludes those that have `label2` equal to "bar".
  A user can specify multiple `include` and `exclude` labels, which will be connected with an AND operator. For example:
  ```
  GET /api/v1/:bucket/:entry/q?include-<label1>=foo&include-<label2>=bar
  ```
- Version 1.4: the method has the `continuous` flag. If it is true, the current query will not be discarded if there are no records.
  A client can ask them later. The query will not be removed until its TTL has expired. The `stop` parameter is ignored for continuous queries.
- Version 1.6: the method provides the `limit` query parameter. It limits the number of records in the query. If it is not set, the query is unlimited by default.
- Version 1.10: the method has the `each_n` and `each_s` query parameters. If the `each_n` parameter is set, the method returns only every `each_n`-th record. If the `each_s` parameter is set, the method returns only one record per `each_s` seconds.

:::warning
Since version 1.13, te method is deprecated. Use the [**Query API**](/docs/http-api/entry-api/run_query.mdx) instead.

## Reading only meta information

Sometimes you need to retrieve only the meta information about a record without its content, ReductStore provides the `HEAD` version of the read endpoints for this purpose.

<SwaggerComponent
  method="HEAD"
  path="/api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name"
  summary="Get only meta information about record"
  description={
    <>
      The endpoint works exactly as
      <br />
      <code>GET /api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name</code>
      <br />
      but returns only headers with meta information with a body.
    </>
  }
/>
