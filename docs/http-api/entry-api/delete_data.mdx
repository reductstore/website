# Entry API to Delete Data

The API provides several endpoints for deleting data from an entry in the database. It can be an entire entry,  a specific record, a batch of records in a single request or records within a time range.


import SwaggerComponent from "@site/src/components/SwaggerComponent";


<SwaggerComponent
    method="DELETE"
    path="/api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name"
    summary="Remove a record from an entry or the entire entry"
    description={
        <>
            The method removes a record from an entry or the entire entry.
            If the `ts` query parameter is set, the record with the timestamp is removed.
            Otherwise, the entire entry is removed.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read access to the entry's bucket.
