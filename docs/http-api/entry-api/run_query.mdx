# Entry API to Run Query

The API provides a single endpoint for running queries on an entry in the database to retrieve or delete data via a timerange, labels, and other parameters.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.13: the method was introduced.

import SwaggerComponent from "@site/src/components/SwaggerComponent";

<SwaggerComponent
  method="POST"
  path="/api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name/q"
  summary="Run a query on an entry"
  fullWidth={false}
  parameters={[
    {
      type: "path",
      details: {
        name: ":bucket_name",
        isRequired: true,
        description: "Name of bucket",
      },
    },
    {
      type: "path",
      details: {
        name: ":entry_name",
        isRequired: true,
        description: "Name of entry",
      },
    },
  ]}
  responses={[
    {
      status: "200",
      message: "OK",
      summary:
        "The query was successful. The response contains the requested data depending on the query parameters.",
      description: (

          <code>"string"</code>
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      status: "204",
      message: "No Content",
      summary: "If there is no record available for the given query",
    },
    {
      status: "401",
      message: "Unauthorized",
      summary: "Access token is invalid or empty",
    },
    {
      status: "403",
      message: "Forbidden",

    },
    {
      status: "404",
      message: "Not Found",

    },
    {
      status: "422",
      message: "Unprocessable Entity",
      summary: "Bad timestamp",
    },
  ]}
/>

### JSON Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object with the following parameters:

```typescript
{
    // Required. The type of query to run. Possible values are "QUERY" and "DELETE".
    query_type: "string"

    // Optional. The start UNIX timestamp of the query in microseconds.
    // If not set, the query starts from the beginning of the entry.
    start?: "integer"

    // Optional. The end UNIX timestamp of the query in microseconds.
    // If not set, the query continues to the end of the entry.
    end?: "integer"

    // Optional. A list of labels to include in the query.
    // Only records with all the specified labels are included.
    include?: "Dict[string, string]"

    // Optional. A list of labels to exclude in the query.
    // Records with any of the specified labels are excluded.
    exclude?: "Dict[string, string]"

    // Optional. The maximum number of records to return.
    limit?: "integer"

    // Optional. If true, the query will remain open
    // for continuous data retrieval until TTL is reached.
    continuous?: "boolean"
}
```

**Example**:

```json
{
  "query_type": "QUERY",
  "start": 1630000000000000,
  "end": 1630000001000000,
  "include": {
    "sensor": "temperature",
    "location": "room1"
  },
  "limit": 100
}
```

## Retrieve Records

If the query type is `QUERY`, the API returns a JSON object with the query ID:

```typescript
{
  id: "integer";
}
```

The query ID must be used to retrieve the query results. See the [**Get a Record from an Entry**](/docs/http-api/entry-api/read_data.mdx#get-a-record-from-an-entry) and
[**Get a Batch of Records from an Entry**](/docs/http-api/entry-api/read_data.mdx#get-a-batch-of-records-from-an-entry) sections for more details.

## Delete Records

If the query type is `DELETE`, the API returns a JSON object with the number of records deleted:

```typescript
{
  removed_records: "integer";
}
```
