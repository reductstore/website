# Entry API to Update Data

The API provides several endpoints for updating labels of a **[record](../../glossary#record)** or multiple records in a single request.

import SwaggerComponent from "@site/src/components/SwaggerComponent";

## Update Labels of a Record

The method allows to update labels of an existing record. It receives
labels in headers that start with `x-reduct-label-` and updates
the labels or adds new ones. If a header with a label is empty, the label
is removed. Because the content of the record is immutable, the method doesn't expect a body.

All existing labels not mentioned in the request stay unchanged.

The method needs a valid API token with write access to the **[entry](../../glossary#entry)**'s **[bucket](../../glossary#bucket)**
if authentication is enabled.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.11: The method was introduced.
- Version 1.18: returns `409 Conflict` if the bucket or entry is being deleted.

## Update Labels of Multiple Records

This method allows to update labels of multiple records in a single request. A client should describe the
records in headers according to [the Batch Protocol](/docs/http-api/entry-api/index.mdx#batch-protocol).

Existing labels not mentioned in the request stay unchanged.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.18: returns `409 Conflict` if the bucket or entry is being deleted.

<SwaggerComponent
  method="PATCH"
  path="/api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name/batch"
  summary="Update labels of multiple records"
  responses={[
    {
      status: "200",
      message: "OK",
      summary:
        "The request was valid. However, some records may not be written. Check headers.",
    },
    {
      status: "400",
      message: "Bad Request",
      summary: "Posted content bigger or smaller than content-length",
    },
    {
      status: "401",
      message: "Unauthorized",
      summary: "Access token is invalid or empty",
    },
    {
      status: "403",
      message: "Forbidden",

    },
    {
      status: "404",
      message: "Not Found",
      summary: "Bucket or entry is not found",
    },
    {
      status: "409",
      message: "Conflict",
      summary: "The bucket is being deleted or the entry is being deleted",
    },
    {
      status: "422",
      message: "Unprocessable Entity",
      summary: "Bad header format",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Rename an Entry

To rename an entry, the request should have a JSON document with the new name.

If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with full access.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.12: The method was introduced.
- Version 1.18: returns `409 Conflict` if the bucket or entry is being deleted.
