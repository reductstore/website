# Entry API to Update Data

The API provides several endpoints for updating labels of a record or multiple records in a single request.

import SwaggerComponent from "@site/src/components/SwaggerComponent";

## Update Labels of a Record

The method allows to update labels of an existing record. It receives
labels in headers that start with `x-reduct-label-``and updates
the labels or adds new ones. If a header with a label is empty, the label
is removed. Because the content of the record is immutable, the method doesn't expect a body, and the content-length header is required, but must be 0.

All existing labels not mentioned in the request stay unchanged.

The method needs a valid API token with write access to the entry's bucket
if authentication is enabled.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.11: The method was introduced.

<SwaggerComponent
  method="PATCH"
  path="/api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name"
  summary="Update labels of a record"
  parameters={[
    {
      type: "path",
      details: {
        name: ":bucket_name",
        description: "Name of bucket",
        isRequired: true,
      },
    },
    {
      type: "path",
      details: {
        name: ":entry_name",
        description: "Name of entry",
        isRequired: true,
      },
    },
    {
      type: "query",
      details: {
        name: "ts",
        dataType: "Integer",
        description: "A UNIX timestamp in microseconds",
        isRequired: true,
      },

        name: "Content-Length",
        description: "Content-length is required but must be 0",
        isRequired: true,
      },
    },
    {
      type: "header",
      details: {
        name: "x-reduct-label-[name]",
        description: "A value of a label assigned to the record",
        isRequired: false,
      },
    },
  ]}
  responses={[
    {
      status: "200",
      message: "OK",
      summary: "The record is written",
    },
    {
      status: "400",
      message: "Bad Request",
      summary: "Posted content bigger or smaller than content-length",
    },
    {

      message: "Unauthorized",
      summary: "Access token is invalid or empty",
    },
    {
      status: "403",
      message: "Forbidden",
      summary: "Access token does not have write permissions",
    },
    {
      status: "404",

    },
    {

      message: "Unprocessable Entity",
      summary: "Bad timestamp",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Update Labels of Multiple Records

This method allows to update labels of multiple records in a single request. A client should describe the
records in headers according to [the Batch Protocol](/docs/http-api/entry-api/index.mdx#batch-protocol). The content-length header is required but must be 0.

Existing labels not mentioned in the request stay unchanged.

<SwaggerComponent
  method="PATCH"
  path="/api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name/batch"
  summary="Update labels of multiple records"
  responses={[
    {
      status: "200",
      message: "OK",
      summary:
        "The request was valid. However, some records may not be written. Check headers.",
    },
    {
      status: "400",
      message: "Bad Request",
      summary: "Posted content bigger or smaller than content-length",
    },
    {
      status: "401",
      message: "Unauthorized",
      summary: "Access token is invalid or empty",
    },
    {
      status: "403",
      message: "Forbidden",
      summary: "Access token does not have write permissions",
    },
    {
      status: "404",
      message: "Not Found",
      summary: "Bucket or entry is not found",
    },
    {
      status: "422",
      message: "Unprocessable Entity",
      summary: "Bad header format",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Rename an Entry

To rename an entry, the request should have a JSON document with the new name.

If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with full access.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.12: The method was introduced.

<SwaggerComponent
  method="PUT"
  path="/api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name/rename"
  summary="Rename an entry"
  parameters={[
    {
      type: "path",
      details: {
        name: ":bucket_name",
        description: "Name of bucket",
        isRequired: true,
      },
    },
    {
      type: "path",
      details: {
        name: ":entry_name",
        description: "Name of entry",
        isRequired: true,
      },
    },
    {
      type: "body",
      details: {
        name: "new_name",
        description: "New name of the entry",
        dataType: "String",
        isRequired: true,
      },
    },
  ]}
  responses={[
    {
      status: "200",
      message: "OK",
      summary: "The entry is renamed",
    },
    {
      status: "401",
      message: "Unauthorized",
      summary: "Access token is invalid or empty",
    },
    {
      status: "403",
      message: "Forbidden",
      summary: "Access token doesn't have enough permissions",
    },
    {
      status: "404",
      message: "Not Found",
      summary: "Bucket or entry doesn't exist",
    },
    {
      status: "409",
      message: "Conflict",
      summary: "Entry with the new name already exists",
    },
    {
      status: "422",
      message: "Unprocessable Entity",
      summary: "JSON request is invalid",
    },
  ]}
/>
