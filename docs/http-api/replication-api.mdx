# Replication API Specification Reference

ReductStore supports append-only **[replication](../glossary#replication)**. This feature allows you to replicate records from one **[bucket](../glossary#bucket)** to another.
To use the replication feature, you must create a replication task with the source and destination buckets.
This reference describes the API for managing replication tasks.

The API is available at the `/api/v1/replications` endpoint and requires an **[access token](../glossary#access-token)** with full access.

For more information about replications, read the [**Replication Guide**](../guides/data-replication).

## Get a List of Replication Tasks

The method returns a list of replication Task with their statuses.

**Changes**:

- v1.8: The endpoint was added

      "is_provisioned": "bool"      // true if replication is provisioned
      "is_active": "bool"           // true if replication is active means that the destination bucket is available and no communication errors occurred
      "pending_records": "int"      // number of records that are not yet replicated
    }
  ]
}`}</code>

## Show Information about a Replication Task

This method provides complete information about a replication task, including
diagnostics and settings.
