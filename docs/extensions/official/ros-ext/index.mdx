# ReductROS

The ReductROS [**extension**](../../glossary#extension) provides tools that can be used to extract and transform data stored in ReductStore into formats that are compatible with the Robot Operating System (ROS).
It allows users to query and convert historical data, such as sensor readings and camera images, into the JSON format, which can then be easily used for analysis, visualisation or integration with other systems.

## Supported file and message formats

The ReductROS extension supports parsing and extracting data from:

- **[MCAP](./ros-ext/mcap)** files containing messages encoded in the **CDR (Common Data Representation)** format used by ROS 2.
- **[Rosbag](./ros-ext/rosbag)** files (planned, not yet supported).
