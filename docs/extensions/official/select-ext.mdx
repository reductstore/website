# ReductSelect Extension

The **ReductSelect** [**extension**](../../glossary#extension) is a powerful tool that enables you to manipulate columnar data on the storage side.
It allows you to select specific columns, filter data and perform various operations before returning it to the client.

import DemoLicenseNote from "@site/src/components/promotional/DemoLicenseNote";

## Query Format

Currently, the extension supports JSON and comma-separated CSV data with and without headers. Stored CSV data can be single- or multi-line and can contain any number of columns.
By default, the extension will use the CSV format. To switch to JSON format, you need to specify the `json` object in the query.

```python
{
    # CSV specific parameters
    "csv": {
        "has_headers": "boolean"  # Indicates if the CSV data has headers, default is false
    },
    # Switch to JSON format
    "json": {
    },
    "columns": [
        {
            # Column index to select
            "index": "number",
            # Name of the column to select, it can be used only if the CSV data has headers
            "name": "string",
            # Select a range of columns starting from this index until the end or `to` index
            "from": "number",
            # Select a range of columns starting from this index until the end or `from` index
            "to": "number",
            # Name of the label to use in the query condition
            "as_label": "string"
        }
    ]
}
```

### CSV Support

Currently, the extension only supports comma-separated CSV data with and without headers. Stored CSV data can be single- or multi-line and can contain any number of columns.

The CSV format example:

```
[header1,header2,header3]
100,true,message string
200,false,another message
300,true,yet another message
```

#### Parameters

The `csv` object contains parameters that specify how to handle the CSV data. If it is not specified, the extension will use the default values.

| Parameter     | Type    | Mandatory | Default | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `has_headers` | boolean | No        | false   | Indicates if the CSV data has headers. If set to `true`, the extension will use the first row as headers. Default is `false`. |

#### Column Selection

The `columns` array contains objects that specify the columns to select from the columnar data.

| Parameter  | Type   | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index`    | number | No\*      | The index of the column to select. It can be used with `as_label` to map the selected column to a computed label.                |
| `name`     | string | No\*      | The name of the column to select. It can be used only if the CSV data has headers.                                               |
| `from`     | number | No\*      | The starting index of the range of columns to select. It can be used with `to` to specify the end of the range.                  |
| `to`       | number | No\*      | The ending index of the range of columns to select. It can be used with `from` to specify the start of the range.                |
| `as_label` | string | No        | The name of the label to use in the query condition. It can be used with `index` to map the selected column to a computed label. |

:::info
\*Each column object must have an index, name or a range of columns to select.
:::

### JSON Support

#### Parameters

The `json` object is used to specify that the data is in JSON format. If it is not specified, the extension will use the default CSV format.

#### Field Selection

The `columns` array contains objects that specify the fields to select from the JSON data. Each object can contain a `name` property to specify the field to select.

```json
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "field1.field2",
      "as_label": "computed_label"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Parameter  | Type   | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | string | Yes       | The name of the field to select. It can be used with `as_label` to map the selected field to a computed label. It can also contain a path to a nested field, e.g. `field1.field2`. |
| `as_label` | string | No        | The name of the label to use in the query condition. It can be used with `name` to map the selected field to a computed label.                                                     |

:::info
Only primitives like strings, numbers, and booleans can be mapped to computed labels.
:::

### Filtering

If a column is specified with the `as_label` property, the extension will return the selected column as a [**computed label**](../../glossary#computed-label) that can be used in the query condition.
The extension will apply the extension `when` condition on each row of the columnar data, filtering the records based on the specified labels.

For example, for the following query:

<div>
    <div style={{width: '50%', float: 'left'}}>
        ```json
        {
            "#ext": {
                "select": {
                    "csv": {
                        "has_headers": true
                    },
                    "columns": [
                        {
                            "name": "col1",
                            "as_label": "col1"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "when": {
                    "@col1": {
                        "$gt": 10
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    </div>
    <div style={{width: '50%', float: 'right', padding: '0 20px'}}>

        The following CSV record:

        | col1 | col2 | col3 |
        | --- | ----- | ------------------- |
        | 20 | false | another message |
        | 0 | false | message string |
        | 30 | true | yet another message |

        will be transformed to:

        | col1 |
        | --- |
        | 20 |
        | 30 |

    </div>

</div>
<div style={{clear: 'both'}}></div>

You can find more information about the conditional queries in the [**Conditional Query Reference**](../../conditional-query) documentation.

:::info
When the extension merges the rows back into the output document, the computed labels retain the values from the first row of the columnar data.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use the **ReductSelect** extension to select specific columns from a CSV file and filter its rows based on these columns.
Although this example is written in Python, it can be run using any of the official SDKs.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

### Selecting Columns from CSV Data

This example demonstrates how to use the select extension to extract specific columns from CSV data stored in ReductStore, apply filtering based on column values, and return a transformed dataset.

import SelectQueryPy from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/py/src/ext_select_csv_query.py";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{SelectQueryPy}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Expected Output

The expected output of the above code is as follows:

```
Record timestamp: 1749797653273752
Record labels: {'@col1': '1'}
1,3,4
6,8,9
Record timestamp: 1749797653273753
Record labels: {'@col1': '1'}
1,3,4
6,8,9
```

#### Explanation

- The extension extracts:
  - Column 0 (1, 6, 11) as @col1, which becomes a label.
  - Columns 2 to 4 (3rd to 5th values) to include in the result rows.
- The when clause filters out rows where @col1 >= 10 — removing the row 11,12,13,14,15.
- The result includes only the selected columns of the remaining rows:
  - From 1,2,3,4,5: → 1 as label, 3,4 as data → becomes 1,3,4
  - From 6,7,8,9,10: → 6 as label, 8,9 as data → becomes 6,8,9
- Each record corresponds to one of the two writes, and both match the filter (@col1 = 1 from the first row of each block).

### Selecting Columns from CSV Data with Headers

This example demonstrates how to use the select extension to work with CSV data that includes a header row.
You can extract specific columns by their header names and apply filters based on their values.

import SelectQueryHeadersPy from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/py/src/ext_select_csv_query_with_headers.py";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{SelectQueryHeadersPy}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Expected Output

The expected output of the above code is as follows:

```
Record timestamp: 1749797694120873
Record labels: {'@col_e': '5'}
e
5
Record timestamp: 1749797694120874
Record labels: {'@col_e': '5'}
e
5
```

#### Explanation

- The input CSV includes a header row: a,b,c,d,e.
- The `csv.has_headers=true` option tells the extension to use the first row as column headers.
- The query selects only the column named "e" and exposes it as label @col_e.
- The when clause filters out any row where column "e" is 10 or more — so the rows with e=10 and e=15 are excluded.
- Only the row 1,2,3,4,5 remains, where e=5.
- The query runs over two records, so the same filtered output appears twice, once per record timestamp.

### Selecting Fields from JSON Data

This example demonstrates how to use the select extension to extract specific fields from JSON data stored in ReductStore, apply filtering based on field values, and return a transformed dataset.

import SelectQueryJsonPy from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/py/src/ext_select_json_query.py";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{SelectQueryJsonPy}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Expected Output

The expected output of the above code is as follows:

```
Record timestamp: 1753776773034850
Record labels: {'@status': 'ok'}
JSON data: [{'temp': {'status': 'ok'}}]
```

#### Explanation

- The `json` object specifies that the data is in JSON format.
- The extension extracts the field `temp.status` from the JSON data
- The `as_label` property is used to map the extracted field to a computed label `@status`.
- The `when` clause filters out any record where `@status` is not equal to `ok`.
- The result includes only the selected field of the remaining records:
  - The record with `temp.status` equal to `ok` is returned as a JSON object with the field `temp`
  - The computed label `@status` is set to `ok` based on the value of the extracted field.
