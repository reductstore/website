# ReductSelect Extension

The **ReductSelect** extension is a powerful tool that enables you to manipulate columnar data on the storage side.
It enables you to select specific columns, filter data and perform various operations before returning it to the client.

:::info
The extension is only available under a commercial licence. If you wish to use it for non-commercial purposes, please [**contact us**](/contact).
:::

## Description

The [**extension**](../../glossary#extension) addresses the need for efficient data manipulation in columnar formats. It does this without the overhead of transferring large datasets to the client for processing, and enables users to perform operations such as selecting specific columns, filtering data and applying transformations directly in storage.

## Data Format

Currently, the extension only supports single-line CSV records without headers.
Data is expected to be in columnar format, with each [**record**](../../glossary#extension) represented as a single line in the CSV file, separated by commas.

## Query Syntax

The extension expects a JSON object with the following structure:

```python
{
    "columns": [
        {
            # Column index to select
            "index": "number",
            # Select a range of columns starting from this index until the end or `to` index
            "from": "number",
            # Select a range of columns starting from this index until the end or `from` index
            "to": "number",
            # Name of the label to use in the query condition
            "as_label": "string"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Column Selection

The `columns` array contains objects that specify the columns to select from the CSV data.

| Parameter  | Type   | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index`    | number | No\*      | The index of the column to select. It can be used with `as_label` to map the selected column to a label.                |
| `from`     | number | No\*      | The starting index of the range of columns to select. It can be used with `to` to specify the end of the range.         |
| `to`       | number | No\*      | The ending index of the range of columns to select. It can be used with `from` to specify the start of the range.       |
| `as_label` | string | No        | The name of the label to use in the query condition. It can be used with `index` to map the selected column to a label. |

:::info
Each column object must have an index or a range of columns to select.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the **ReductSelect** extension to select specific columns from a CSV file and filter the data based on these columns.
Although the example is written in Python, you can use any of the official SDKs to run it.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

import SelectQueryPy from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/py/src/ext_select_query.py";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{SelectQueryPy}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The expected output of the above code is as follows:

```
Record timestamp: 1747389597415517
Record labels: {'@col1': '1'}
b'1,3,4\n'
Record timestamp: 1747389597415518
Record labels: {'@col1': '6'}
b'6,8,9\n'
```
