# ReductSelect Extension

The **ReductSelect** extension is a powerful tool that allows you to manipulate data in columnar formats on the storage side. It enables you to select specific columns, filter data, and perform various operations on the data before it is returned to the client.

The extension is available only under commercial license. If you want to use it for non-commercial purposes, please [**contact us**](/contact).

## Description

The [**extension**](../../glossary#extension) addresses the need for efficient data manipulation in columnar formats without the overhead of transferring large datasets to the client for processing. By leveraging the extension, users can perform operations such as selecting specific columns, filtering data, and applying transformations directly on the storage side.

## Data Format

Currently, the extension supports single line CSV records without headers.
The data is expected to be in a columnar format, where each [**record**](../../glossary#extension) is represented as a single line in the CSV file delimited by commas.

## Query Syntax

The extension expects a JSON object with the following structure:

```python
{
    "columns": [
        {
            # Column index to select
            "index": "number",
            # Select a range of columns starting from this index until the end or `to` index
            "from": "number",
            # Select a range of columns starting from this index until the end or `from` index
            "to": "number",
            # Name of the label to use in the query condition
            "as_label": "string"
        }
    ]
}
```

Each column object can must have an index or a range of columns to select. The `from` and `to` properties are optional and can be used to select a range of columns starting from the specified index until the end or the specified `to` index.
The `as_label` property is optional and can be used to specify the name of the label to use in the query condition.
It works only with the `index` property and is ignored when using the `from` and `to` properties.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the **ReductSelect** extension to select specific columns from a CSV file and filter the data based on the selected columns.
The example is written in Python , however, you can use any of the official SDKs to run it.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

import SelectQueryPy from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/py/src/ext_select_query.py";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{SelectQueryPy}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The expected output of the above code is:

```
Record timestamp: 1747389597415517
Record labels: {'@col1': '1'}
b'1,3,4\n'
Record timestamp: 1747389597415518
Record labels: {'@col1': '6'}
b'6,8,9\n'
```
