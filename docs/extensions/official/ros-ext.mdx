# ReductROS

The ReductROS [**extension**](../../glossary#extension) provides tools that can be used to extract and transform data stored in ReductStore into formats that are compatible with the Robot Operating System (ROS).
It allows users to query and convert historical data, such as sensor readings and camera images, into text-based formats like CSV or JSON, which can then be easily used for analysis, visualisation or integration with other systems.

:::info
The extension is only available under a commercial licence. If you wish to use it for non-commercial purposes, please [**contact us**](/contact).

## Supported File and Message Formats

The ReductROS extension supports parsing and extracting data exclusively from [MCAP](https://mcap.dev/) files containing messages encoded in the [CDR (Common Data Representation)](https://design.ros2.org/articles/serialization.html) format—used as the default serialization method in ROS 2.

These `.mcap` files typically originate from ROS 2 logging tools and encapsulate serialized messages across multiple topics, along with metadata such as timestamps and message types. ReductROS provides functionality to:

- **Decode CDR-encoded ROS 2 messages** embedded in MCAP files.
- **Extract specific topics** from the MCAP file based on user-defined parameters and convert them into JSON format.
- **Encode binary data** (e.g., images, point clouds) into base64 strings or JPEG format for easier handling and analysis.
- **Expose metadata**, including topic names, timestamps, and message types alongside message content.

### Input

- `.mcap` files containing ROS 2 messages in binary CDR format

### Output

- `JSON` representations of ROS 2 messages
- `timestamp` from the message header
- `computed_labels` containing metadata such as topic name, message type, and encoding

This output format is ideal for analysis, visualization, integration with external systems, or further transformation to other formats.

## Query Format

A user can use the `ext` query parameter to activate the `ros` extension and define the parameters for extracting and transforming ROS data in the following format:

```python
{
    "ext": {
        "ros": {
            "extract": {
               "topic": "string",  # The name of the ROS topic to extract messages from
               "encode": "object"  # Dictionary of binary files to encode, e.g., {"data": "jpeg"} for JPEG encoding
            },
            "transform": {
              "split": {
                "duration": "32h",  # Max episode duration
                "size": "100MB"  # Max episode size
              },
              "topics": {
                "include": [ "topic-1", "/topic-.*/" ],  # List of topics to include (regular expressions)
                "exclude": [ "topic-b", "/ext-.*/" ]  # List of topics to exclude (regular expressions)
              }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Data Extraction

The `extract` property allows you to specify the ROS topic from which to extract message and convert it to JSON format.
The extension will read the MCAP file, decode the messages from the specified topic, and return each message as a JSON record with
the timestamp from the message header.

| Parameter        | Type     | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `topic`          | `string` | Yes       | The name of the ROS topic to extract messages from. This should match the topic names used in the MCAP file.                                                 |
| `encode`         | `object` | No        | A dictionary specifying how to encode binary data in the messages. For example, `{"data": "jpeg"}` for JPEG encoding.                                        |
| `encode.<field>` | `string` | No        | The encoding format for binary fields in the message. Supported values are `base64` and `jpeg`. If not specified, the field will be returned as a JSON list. |

#### Encoding Binary Data

The `encode` property allows you to specify how to handle binary data in the extracted messages.
You can choose to encode binary fields in the following formats:

| Format   | Description                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base64` | Encodes binary data as a base64 string, suitable for text-based formats like JSON.       |
| `jpeg`   | Encodes binary data as a JPEG image encoded to a base64 string, suitable for image data. |

:::info
Currently, the extension supports encoding only **[sensor_msgs/msg/Image](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html)** messages with `encoding` set to `rgb8`, `bgr8`, or `mono8`.
:::

### Data Transformation

The `transform` property allows you to generate new MCAP episodes with topic filtering and size/duration limits.

| Field              | Type       | Mandatory | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `split.duration`   | `string`   | No        | Maximum duration per episode (e.g., `15m`, `2h`, `1d`).                       |
| `split.size`       | `string`   | No        | Maximum file size per episode (e.g., `100MB`, `1GB`).                         |
| `topics.include[]` | `string[]` | No        | Regular expressions to include topics. If omitted, all topics are considered. |
| `topics.exclude[]` | `string[]` | No        | Regular expressions to exclude topics. Applied **after** `include`.           |

:::info
If neither `split.duration` nor `split.size` is provided, the transform will output the original MCAP files with only topic filtering applied.  
If both `split.duration` and `split.size` are provided, whichever limit is reached first triggers a new episode.
:::

#### Transforming MCAP

When `transform` is provided, the extension:

1. Reads the source MCAP files.
2. Applies topic filters (`include` first, then `exclude`).
3. Streams matching messages into a new MCAP writer.
4. Starts a new episode whenever `split.duration` or `split.size` is reached.

**Example**

```json
{
  "ext": {
    "ros": {
      "transform": {
        "split": { "duration": "1m", "size": "500MB" },
        "topics": {
          "include": ["/camera/.*", "^/imu/data$"],
          "exclude": ["/camera/debug"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**

- All topics starting with `/camera/` are included (because of `/camera/.*`).
- The topic `/imu/data` is included exactly (because of `^/imu/data$`).
- The topic `/camera/debug` is excluded, even though it matches the `/camera/.*` rule.
- Output is a sequence of MCAP episodes, each ≤ 1 minute or ≤ 500 MB (whichever comes first).

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use the **ReductROS** extension to extract and transform ROS messages.
Although this example is written in Python, it can be run using any of the official SDKs.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

### Extracting Messages as JSON

This example demonstrates how to use the ROS extension to extract topic from an MCAP file stored in ReductStore and
convert it to JSON format.

import RosExtractTopicPy from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/py/src/ext_ros_mcap_extract.py";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{RosExtractTopicPy}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Expected Output

The expected output of the above code is as follows:

```
Record timestamp: 24
Record labels: {'@encoding': 'cdr', '@schema': 'std_msgs/String', '@topic': '/test'}
{"data":"hello"}
Record timestamp: 25
Record labels: {'@encoding': 'cdr', '@schema': 'std_msgs/String', '@topic': '/test'}
{"data":"world"}
```

#### Explanation

- The extension extracts ROS 2 messages from an `.mcap` file stored in ReductStore.
- Only messages from the topic `/test` are selected using the `topic` filter in the `ros.extract` configuration.
- The content of each message is CDR-encoded and decoded by the extension.
- The decoded message is returned as JSON with the field `data`, matching the `std_msgs/String` schema.
- Each record corresponds to one ROS 2 message and includes:
  - The decoded JSON payload, e.g., `{"data":"hello"}`
  - Message metadata as labels, including:
    - `topic`: `/test`
    - `schema`: `std_msgs/String`
    - `encoding`: `cdr`

### Extracting Messages as JSON with JPEG Encoding

This example demonstrates how to use the ROS extension to extract topic from an MCAP file stored in ReductStore and
convert it to JSON format, while also encoding binary image data into JPEG format.

import RosExtractImagePy from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/py/src/ext_ros_mcap_extract_jpeg.py";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{RosExtractImagePy}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Expected Output

The expected output of the above code is as follows:

```
Record timestamp: 1753341400522732
Record labels: {'@encoding': 'cdr', '@schema': 'sensor_msgs/Image', '@topic': '/image_raw'}
Image parameters: {'height': 720, 'width': 1280, 'is_bigendian': 0, 'encoding': 'rgb8', 'step': 3840, 'header': {'frame_id': 'camera', 'stamp': {'sec': 1753341400, 'nanosec': 522732248}}}
```

#### Explanation

- The extension extracts ROS 2 messages from an `.mcap` file stored in ReductStore.
- Only messages from the topic `/image_raw` are selected using the `topic` filter in the `ros.extract` configuration.
- The content of each message is CDR-encoded and decoded by the extension.
- The decoded message is returned as JSON with the field `data`, which contains the image data encoded in JPEG format.
- Each record corresponds to one ROS 2 message and includes:
  - The decoded image parameters, such as height, width, encoding, and step.
  - The timestamp from the message header.
  - Message metadata as labels, including:
    - `topic`: `/image_raw`
    - `schema`: `sensor_msgs/Image`
    - `encoding`: `cdr`

### Transforming MCAP with Splitting and Topic Filtering

This example demonstrates how to use the ROS extension to create new MCAP episodes while including and excluding topics using regular expressions.

import RosTransformMcapPy from "!!raw-loader!../../examples/py/src/ext_ros_mcap_transform.py";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{RosTransformMcapPy}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Expected Output

The expected output of the above code is as follows:

```
Record timestamp: 1753341400522732
Episode file size: 104857600 bytes
Record timestamp: 1753345000123456
Episode file size: 209715200 bytes
```

#### Explanation

- The extension reads an `.mcap` file stored in ReductStore.
- Only topics matching `topic-1` and `/topic-.*/` are included.
- Topics matching `topic-b` and `/ext-.*/` are excluded.
- The extension writes a sequence of new MCAP episodes capped at **1 minute** or **100 MB**, whichever comes first.
