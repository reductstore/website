# ⚙ Server Configuration and Provisioning

## Settings

### General

ReductStore uses environment variables for configuration. Here is a list of available settings:

| Name                   | Default                                         | Description                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_LOG_LEVEL`         | INFO                                            | Logging level: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR. A user can filter logs by path e.g. `INFO,reductstore/api=DEBUG`       |
| `RS_HOST`              | 0.0.0.0                                         | Listening IP address                                                                                                      |
| `RS_PORT`              | 8383                                            | Listening port                                                                                                            |
| `RS_API_BASE_PATH`     | /                                               | Prefix for all URLs of requests                                                                                           |
| `RS_PUBLIC_URL`        | http(s)://[RS_HOST]:[RS_PORT][RS_API_BASE_PATH] | Public URL of the instance. Used for **[query links](./glossary#query-link)**.                                            |
| `RS_DATA_PATH`         | /data                                           | Path to a folder where the storage stores the data                                                                        |
| `RS_API_TOKEN`         |                                                 | If set, the storage uses token authorization                                                                              |
| `RS_CERT_PATH`         |                                                 | Path to an SSL certificate. If unset, the storage uses HTTP instead of HTTPS                                              |
| `RS_CERT_KEY_PATH`     |                                                 | Path to the private key of the desired SSL certificate. Should be set with RS_CERT_PATH                                   |
| `RS_LICENSE_PATH`      |                                                 | Path to the license file. Required for commercial usage. See **[Pricing](/pricing)** for more details.                    |
| `RS_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` |                                                 | Sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin header`. Use `*` to allow all origins or list specific origins separated by commas. |
| `RS_EXT_PATH`          |                                                 | If set, it activates the experimental extension API. The path should be a folder with extension binaries.                 |

**For Snap Users**

If you use snap, you can configure the database by using the `snap set` command:

```
snap set reductstore log-level=DEBUG
```

This command changes the log level to DEBUG and restarts the database. You can check the current configuration with the `snap get reductstoret` command:

```
snap get reductstore
Key            Value
api-base       /
api-token
cert-key-path
cert-path
data-path      /var/snap/reductstore/common
host           0.0.0.0
log-level      DEBUG
port           8383
```

By default, the database uses the `/var/snap/reductstore/common` folder to store data. Due to snap restrictions, you can't use root filesystem folders.
We recommend that you connect the snap to the `removable-media` interface and store the data in a folder outside the snap in `/mnt/*` or `/media/*` folders:

```
snap connect reductstore:removable-media
mkdir /mnt/data
snap set reductstore data-path=/mnt/data
```

:::danger
Removing the snap will remove all data stored in the default data path. If you want to keep the data, you need to move it to another location before removing the snap.
Or use the `snap connect reductstore:removable-media` command to connect the snap to the `removable-media` interface and store the data in a folder outside the snap.

### Remote Backend Settings

ReductStore supports using a remote object storage as a backend to store data. You can configure the remote backend using the following environment variables:

| Name                     | Default     | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_REMOTE_BACKEND_TYPE` | File system | If it is set to `S3`, the storage uses an S3-compatible object storage as a backend          |
| `RS_REMOTE_ENDPOINT`     |             | URL of the S3-compatible object storage endpoint. It's ignored for the AWS S3 service.       |
| `RS_REMOTE_REGION`       |             | Region of the S3-compatible object storage. It's ignored for on-premises storage like MinIO. |
| `RS_REMOTE_ACCESS_KEY`   |             | Access key for the S3-compatible object storage.                                             |
| `RS_REMOTE_SECRET_KEY`   |             | Secret key for the S3-compatible object storage.                                             |
| `RS_REMOTE_BUCKET`       |             | Name of the bucket to store data. The bucket must be created before starting ReductStore.    |
| `RS_REMOTE_CACHE_PATH`   |             | Path to a folder where the storage caches data before uploading it to the remote backend.    |
| `RS_REMOTE_CACHE_SIZE`   | 1GB         | Maximum size of the cache folder. When the limit is reached, the oldest data is removed.     |

By default, ReductStore uses the local file system to store data. To use a remote backend, set the `RS_REMOTE_BACKEND_TYPE` variable to S3 and configure the other variables accordingly.
When the remote backend is enabled, ReductStore caches data in the folder specified by the `RS_REMOTE_CACHE_PATH` variable, thereby reducing the number of requests made to the remote backend.
The `RS_DATA_PATH` variable is ignored when the remote backend is enabled.

### I/O Settings

In addition to general settings, you can configure I/O settings to optimize communication over HTTP with the storage engine. The following table describes the available environment variables:

| Name                            | Default | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_SIZE`          | 8MB     | Maximum size of a batch of records sent to the client.                                                                                  |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_RECORDS`       | 85      | Maximum number of records in a batch sent and received from the client.                                                                 |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_METADATA_SIZE` | 8KB     | Maximum size of metadata in a batch of records sent and received from the client.                                                       |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_TIMEOUT`           | 5s      | Maximum time for a batch of records to be prepared and sent to the client. If the batch is not full, it will be sent after the timeout. |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_RECORD_TIMEOUT`    | 1s      | Maximum time to wait for a record to be added to a batch. If the record is not added, the unfinished batch will be sent to the client.  |

Most of the I/O settings are related to **[batching](./glossary#batching)** and specify the size of the batch, the number of records in the batch, and the timeout for preparing and sending the batch on the server side.

However, if a client is using the HTTP/1.1 protocol, the `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_METADATA_SIZE` and `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_RECORDS` settings are used to limit the size of the headers in the HTTP request from the client.
This means that the client can't send more records in a single batch than specified by the `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_RECORDS` and the size of the headers in the request can't exceed the value of the `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_METADATA_SIZE` setting.

Read more about batching in the **[HTTP API Reference](./http-api/entry-api#batch-protocol)**.

### Replication Settings

ReductStore supports **[data replication](./guides/data-replication.mdx)** between different instances. You can configure replication settings using the following environment variables:

| Name                      | Default | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_REPLICATION_TIMEOUT`  | 5s      | Timeout for attempts to reconnect to the target server in seconds.                                                      |
| `RS_REPLICATION_LOG_SIZE` | 1000000 | Maximum number of pending records in the replication log. The oldest records are overwritten when the limit is reached. |

## Provisioning

ReductStore provides an **[HTTP API](./glossary#http-api)** to create and configure resources such as buckets, access tokens or **[replication](./glossary#replication)** tasks. However, if you are following an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach, you may want to provision resources at the deployment stage and ensure that they can't be modified or deleted using the HTTP API.

### Example

Here is an example of provisioning two buckets and a token to access them:

```
RS_BUCKET_A_NAME=bucket-1
RS_BUCKET_A_QUOTA_TYPE=FIFO
RS_BUCKET_A_QUOTA_SIZE=1Tb

RS_BUCKET_B_NAME=bucket-2

RS_TOKEN_A_NAME=token
RS_TOKEN_A_VALUE=somesecret
RS_TOKEN_A_READ=bucket-1,bucket-2
```

As you can see, each resource has a type and an ID. The type is `BUCKET` for buckets and `TOKEN` for tokens. The ID is a unique identifier for the resource. You can use any string value for the ID. It is only used to group resources of the same type.

Below you will find the available settings for each resource type.

### Bucket Provisioning

You can provision buckets by setting environment variables. The following table lists the available settings:

| Name                               | Default | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_NAME`              |         | Provisioned **[bucket](./glossary#bucket)** name (required)      |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_QUOTA_TYPE`        | NONE    | It can be NONE, FIFO or HARD.                                    |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_QUOTA_SIZE`        | 0       | Size of quota to start removing old data e.g. 1 KB, 10.4 MB etc. |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`    | 64Mb    | Maximal **[block](./glossary#block)** size for batched records   |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_MAX_BLOCK_RECORDS` | 1024    | Maximal number of batched records in a block                     |

For more information about the bucket settings, see the **[Buckets Guide](./guides/buckets.mdx#bucket-settings)**.

### Token Provisioning

You can provision tokens by setting environment variables. The following table lists the available settings:

| Name                        | Default | Description                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `RS_TOKEN_<ID>_NAME`        |         | Provisioned token name (required)                |
| `RS_TOKEN_<ID>_VALUE`       |         | Provisioned value of token (required)            |
| `RS_TOKEN_<ID>_FULL_ACCESS` | false   | Full access permission                           |
| `RS_TOKEN_<ID>_READ`        |         | List of buckets for reading separate by a comma. |
| `RS_TOKEN_<ID>_WRITE`       |         | List of buckets for writing separate by a comma. |

For more information about the token settings, see the **[Access Control Guide](./guides/access-control.mdx)**.

### Replication Provisioning

You can provision replication tasks by setting environment variables. The following table lists the available settings:

| Name                             | Default | Description                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `RS_REPLICATION_<ID>_NAME`       |         | Provisioned replication task name (required)                                                                       |
| `RS_REPLICATION_<ID>_SRC_BUCKET` |         | Source bucket name (required)                                                                                      |
| `RS_REPLICATION_<ID>_DST_BUCKET` |         | Remote bucket name (required). It must be created before replication                                               |
| `RS_REPLICATION_<ID>_DST_HOST`   |         | URL of destination instance (required). For example, https://play.reduct.store or http://localhost:8383            |
| `RS_REPLICATION_<ID>_DST_TOKEN`  |         | Token for destination instance                                                                                     |
| `RS_REPLICATION_<ID>_ENTRIES`    |         | List of entries to replicate. Separate entries with a comma. If the list is empty, all entries will be replicated. |
