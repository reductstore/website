# ⚙ Server Configuration and Provisioning

## Settings

### General

ReductStore uses environment variables for configuration. Here is a list of available settings:

| Name                   | Default                                         | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_LOG_LEVEL`         | INFO                                            | Logging level: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR. A user can filter logs by path e.g. `INFO,reductstore/api=DEBUG`                            |
| `RS_HOST`              | 0.0.0.0                                         | Listening IP address                                                                                                                           |
| `RS_PORT`              | 8383                                            | Listening port                                                                                                                                 |
| `RS_INSTANCE_ROLE`     | STANDALONE                                      | Role of the instance. It can be `STANDALONE`, `PRIMARY`, `SECONDARY` or `REPLICA`. See **[Instance Roles](#instance-roles)** for more details. |
| `RS_API_BASE_PATH`     | /                                               | Prefix for all URLs of requests                                                                                                                |
| `RS_PUBLIC_URL`        | http(s)://[RS_HOST]:[RS_PORT][RS_API_BASE_PATH] | Public URL of the instance. Used for **[query links](./glossary#query-link)**.                                                                 |
| `RS_DATA_PATH`         | /data                                           | Path to a folder where the storage stores the data                                                                                             |
| `RS_API_TOKEN`         |                                                 | If set, the storage uses token authorization                                                                                                   |
| `RS_CERT_PATH`         |                                                 | Path to an SSL certificate. If unset, the storage uses HTTP instead of HTTPS                                                                   |
| `RS_CERT_KEY_PATH`     |                                                 | Path to the private key of the desired SSL certificate. Should be set with RS_CERT_PATH                                                        |
| `RS_LICENSE_PATH`      |                                                 | Path to the license file. Required for commercial usage. See **[Pricing](/pricing)** for more details.                                         |
| `RS_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` |                                                 | Sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin header`. Use `*` to allow all origins or list specific origins separated by commas.                      |
| `RS_EXT_PATH`          |                                                 | If set, it activates the experimental extension API. The path should be a folder with extension binaries.                                      |

**For Snap Users**

If you use snap, you can configure the database by using the `snap set` command:

```
snap set reductstore log-level=DEBUG
```

This command changes the log level to DEBUG and restarts the database. You can check the current configuration with the `snap get reductstoret` command:

```
snap get reductstore
Key            Value
api-base       /
api-token
cert-key-path
cert-path
data-path      /var/snap/reductstore/common
host           0.0.0.0
log-level      DEBUG
port           8383
```

By default, the database uses the `/var/snap/reductstore/common` folder to store data. Due to snap restrictions, you can't use root filesystem folders.
We recommend that you connect the snap to the `removable-media` interface and store the data in a folder outside the snap in `/mnt/*` or `/media/*` folders:

```
snap connect reductstore:removable-media
mkdir /mnt/data
snap set reductstore data-path=/mnt/data
```

:::danger
Removing the snap will remove all data stored in the default data path. If you want to keep the data, you need to move it to another location before removing the snap.
Or use the `snap connect reductstore:removable-media` command to connect the snap to the `removable-media` interface and store the data in a folder outside the snap.
:::

### Instance Roles

Depending on the deployment scenario, ReductStore can operate in different modes. You can set the instance role using the `RS_INSTANCE_ROLE` environment variable. The available roles are:

| Role         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STANDALONE` | The instance operates independently, handling both read and write operations and doesn't protect data with a lock file.                                                                                                 |
| `PRIMARY`    | The instance acts as the primary node in an active-passive setup, acquiring a lock file to prevent other instances from accessing the same data. It handles both read and write operations.                             |
| `SECONDARY`  | The instance acts as the secondary node in an active-passive setup, acquiring a lock file asymmetrically to the primary instance. It handles both read and write operations but operates only when the primary is down. |
| `REPLICA`    | The instance operates in read-only mode, allowing only read operations. It doesn't acquire a lock file and only serves data.                                                                                            |

### Remote Backend Settings

ReductStore supports using a remote object storage as a backend to store data. You can configure the remote backend using the following environment variables:

| Name                              | Default        | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_REMOTE_BACKEND_TYPE`          | File system    | If it is set to `S3`, the storage uses an S3-compatible object storage as a backend                                       |
| `RS_REMOTE_ENDPOINT`              |                | URL of the S3-compatible object storage endpoint. It's ignored for the AWS S3 service.                                    |
| `RS_REMOTE_REGION`                |                | Region of the S3-compatible object storage. It's ignored for on-premises storage like MinIO.                              |
| `RS_REMOTE_ACCESS_KEY`            |                | Access key for the S3-compatible object storage.                                                                          |
| `RS_REMOTE_SECRET_KEY`            |                | Secret key for the S3-compatible object storage.                                                                          |
| `RS_REMOTE_BUCKET`                |                | Name of the bucket to store data. The bucket must be created before starting ReductStore.                                 |
| `RS_REMOTE_CACHE_PATH`            |                | Path to a folder where the storage caches data before uploading it to the remote backend.                                 |
| `RS_REMOTE_CACHE_SIZE`            | 1GB            | Maximum size of the cache folder. When the limit is reached, the oldest data is removed.                                  |
| `RS_REMOTE_SYNC_INTERVAL`         | 0.1, 60 for S3 | Synchronization interval with the remote backend in seconds.                                                              |
| `RS_REMOTE_DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS` | STANDARD       | Default storage class for data blocks. See the list of **[supported S3 storage classes](#supported-s3-storage-classes)**. |

By default, ReductStore uses the local file system to store data. To use a remote backend, set the `RS_REMOTE_BACKEND_TYPE` variable to S3 and configure the other variables accordingly.
When the remote backend is enabled, ReductStore caches data in the folder specified by the `RS_REMOTE_CACHE_PATH` variable, thereby reducing the number of requests made to the remote backend.
The `RS_DATA_PATH` variable is ignored when the remote backend is enabled.

For end-to-end deployment examples (standalone, active-passive, and read-only replicas) using S3, see the **[S3 integration guide](./integrations/s3)**.

### Supported S3 Storage Classes

A user can specify default storage class for data blocks stored in the S3-compatible object storage using the `RS_REMOTE_DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS` environment variable.
The following storage classes are supported:

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STANDARD`            | Standard storage class. Suitable for frequently accessed data.                                                                      |
| `STANDARD_IA`         | Standard-Infrequent Access storage class. Suitable for data that is infrequently accessed but requires rapid access when needed.    |
| `INTELLIGENT_TIERING` | Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Automatically moves data to the most cost-effective access tier based on usage patterns.         |
| `ONEZONE_IA`          | One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class. Suitable for data that is infrequently accessed and stored in a single availability zone. |
| `EXPRESS_ONEZONE`     | Express-One Zone storage class. Suitable for data that requires low latency access and is stored in a single availability zone.     |
| `GLACIER_IR`          | Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class. Suitable for data that is rarely accessed and requires immediate access when needed.       |
| `GLACIER`             | Glacier storage class. Suitable for data that is rarely accessed and can be retrieved within a few hours.                           |
| `DEEP_ARCHIVE`        | Deep Archive storage class. Suitable for data that is rarely accessed and can be retrieved within 12 hours.                         |
| `OUTPOSTS`            | Outposts storage class. Suitable for data that needs to be stored on AWS Outposts.                                                  |

For more information about S3 storage classes, see the **[Amazon S3 Storage Classes documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/)**.

### I/O Settings

In addition to general settings, you can configure I/O settings to optimize communication over HTTP with the storage engine. The following table describes the available environment variables:

| Name                            | Default | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_SIZE`          | 8MB     | Maximum size of a batch of records sent to the client.                                                                                  |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_RECORDS`       | 85      | Maximum number of records in a batch sent and received from the client.                                                                 |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_METADATA_SIZE` | 8KB     | Maximum size of metadata in a batch of records sent and received from the client.                                                       |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_TIMEOUT`           | 5s      | Maximum time for a batch of records to be prepared and sent to the client. If the batch is not full, it will be sent after the timeout. |
| `RS_IO_BATCH_RECORD_TIMEOUT`    | 1s      | Maximum time to wait for a record to be added to a batch. If the record is not added, the unfinished batch will be sent to the client.  |
| `RS_IO_OPERATION_TIMEOUT`       | 60s     | Maximum time for an I/O operation (e.g., read or write). If the operation takes longer, it will be aborted.                             |

Most of the I/O settings are related to **[batching](./glossary#batching)** and specify the size of the batch, the number of records in the batch, and the timeout for preparing and sending the batch on the server side.

However, if a client is using the HTTP/1.1 protocol, the `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_METADATA_SIZE` and `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_RECORDS` settings are used to limit the size of the headers in the HTTP request from the client.
This means that the client can't send more records in a single batch than specified by the `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_RECORDS` and the size of the headers in the request can't exceed the value of the `RS_IO_BATCH_MAX_METADATA_SIZE` setting.

Read more about batching in the **[HTTP API Reference](./http-api/entry-api#batch-protocol)**.

### Lock File Settings

ReductStore uses a lock file to prevent multiple instances from accessing the same data folder. The lock file is created in the data folder specified by the RS_DATA_PATH variable, using the same storage backend as the data.
You can configure the lock file settings using the following environment variables:

| Name                            | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_LOCK_FILE_POLLING_INTERVAL` | 10s     | Interval between attempts to acquire the lock file or rewrite the acquired lock file to update its timestamp.                                                                                            |
| `RS_LOCK_FILE_ROLE`             | primary | Role of the instance. It can be `primary` or `secondary`. The primary instance acquires the lock file immediately. The secondary instance waits for the primary to acquire the file first.               |
| `RS_LOCK_FILE_TTL`              | 30s     | Time-to-live for the lock file. If the lock file is not updated within the TTL, it is considered stale and can be overwritten by another instance.                                                       |
| `RS_LOCK_FILE_TIMEOUT`          | 60s     | Timeout for acquiring the lock file. If the lock file is not acquired within the timeout, the storage will exit. When set to 0, the storage will wait indefinitely.                                      |
| `RS_LOCK_FILE_FAILURE_ACTION`   | abort   | Action to take if the lock file can't be acquired. It can be `abort` or `proceed`. If set to `abort`, the storage will exit. If set to `proceed`, the storage will overwrite the lock file and continue. |

The lock file is enabled when the `RS_INSTANCE_ROLE` variable is set to `PRIMARY` or `SECONDARY`. If the variable is not set, the lock file mechanism is disabled.

### Storage Engine Settings

A user can configure storage engine settings to change behavior of data storage and retrieval. The following table describes the available environment variables:

| Name                                | Default | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_ENGINE_COMPACTION_INTERVAL`     | 60s     | Interval between compaction WALs into blocks and synchronization of the storage state to the backend. |
| `RS_ENGINE_REPLICA_UPDATE_INTERVAL` | 60s     | Interval between updates of bucket, entry lists and indexes from the backend in the read-only mode.   |

### Replication Settings

ReductStore supports **[data replication](./guides/data-replication.mdx)** between different instances. You can configure replication settings using the following environment variables:

| Name                      | Default | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_REPLICATION_TIMEOUT`  | 5s      | Timeout for attempts to reconnect to the target server in seconds.                                                      |
| `RS_REPLICATION_LOG_SIZE` | 1000000 | Maximum number of pending records in the replication log. The oldest records are overwritten when the limit is reached. |

## Provisioning

ReductStore provides an **[HTTP API](./glossary#http-api)** to create and configure resources such as buckets, access tokens or **[replication](./glossary#replication)** tasks. However, if you are following an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach, you may want to provision resources at the deployment stage and ensure that they can't be modified or deleted using the HTTP API.

### Example

Here is an example of provisioning two buckets and a token to access them:

```
RS_BUCKET_A_NAME=bucket-1
RS_BUCKET_A_QUOTA_TYPE=FIFO
RS_BUCKET_A_QUOTA_SIZE=1Tb

RS_BUCKET_B_NAME=bucket-2

RS_TOKEN_A_NAME=token
RS_TOKEN_A_VALUE=somesecret
RS_TOKEN_A_READ=bucket-1,bucket-2
```

As you can see, each resource has a type and an ID. The type is `BUCKET` for buckets and `TOKEN` for tokens. The ID is a unique identifier for the resource. You can use any string value for the ID. It is only used to group resources of the same type.

Below you will find the available settings for each resource type.

### Bucket Provisioning

You can provision buckets by setting environment variables. The following table lists the available settings:

| Name                               | Default | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_NAME`              |         | Provisioned **[bucket](./glossary#bucket)** name (required)      |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_QUOTA_TYPE`        | NONE    | It can be NONE, FIFO or HARD.                                    |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_QUOTA_SIZE`        | 0       | Size of quota to start removing old data e.g. 1 KB, 10.4 MB etc. |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`    | 64Mb    | Maximal **[block](./glossary#block)** size for batched records   |
| `RS_BUCKET_<ID>_MAX_BLOCK_RECORDS` | 1024    | Maximal number of batched records in a block                     |
