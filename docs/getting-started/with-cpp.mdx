## Installing the C++ SDK

<InstallSdk>
    To install the ReductStore C++ SDK, follow these steps:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cpp.git
    cd reduct-cpp
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    cmake --build .
    sudo cmake --build . --target install
    ```

    This will clone the ReductStore C++ SDK repository, build the SDK, and install it on your system.
    After installing the SDK, you need to link the `ReductCpp` library to your project. The following example shows how
    to do this using CMake:

    ```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

    project(ReductCppExample)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

    find_package(ZLIB)
    find_package(OpenSSL)


    find_package(ReductCpp)

    add_executable(quick_start quick_start.cc)
    target_link_libraries(quick_start ${REDUCT_CPP_LIBRARIES} ${ZLIB_LIBRARIES} OpenSSL::SSL OpenSSL::Crypto)
    ```
</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Hello World Example

<UsingSdkSection example={QuickStart} language="cpp"/>

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create a ReductStore client, you can use the `IClient::Build` fabric method from the `reduct` namespace. Pass the URL of the
    ReductStore instance you wish to connect to as an argument to the method.

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=1. end=2.
    ```
</CreateClientSection>

## Creating a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>

    To create a bucket, you should use the `GetOrCreateBucket` method on a `Client` instance. Pass the name of the bucket
    you want to create as an argument, along with settings.  If the bucket already exists, the `GetOrCreateBucket`
    method will return it:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=2. end=3.
    ```
</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped record to an entry in a bucket, you should use the `Write` method on a `Bucket` instance.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument, along with the timestamp you want to write.
    The `Write` method will call a callback function with the `WritableRecord` instance to write to the entry:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=3. end=4.
    ```
</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `Query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the entry to iterate over, and `start` and `stop` arguments to specify the time interval. The method will
    a callback function with the `ReadableRecord` instance for each record in the time range:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=4. end=5.
    ```
</DataQueryingSection>
