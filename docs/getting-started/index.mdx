# 🚀 Getting Started with ReductStore

ReductStore offers many ways to easily integrate into an existing infrastructure. Choose the one that suits you best.

## Docker

The easiest way to start using ReductStore is to run Docker image:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383 -v ${PWD}/data:/data reduct/store:latest
```

The database will be available on port `http://127.0.01:8383` and stores data in the `./data` directory. You may check if it's working with a simple HTTP request:

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8383/api/v1/info
```

## Pre-built Binaries

You can use pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS or Windows operating systems. Download a binary for your OS and platform from [**GitHub release page**](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/releases/latest).  Extract the file and then type the commands:

On Windows:

```
set RS_DATA_PATH=C:\<PATH_TO_DATA>
.\reductstore
```

On Linux or macOS

```
RS_DATA_PATH=./data ./reductstore
```

## Cargo

**Build Requirements:**

* Minimal Rust version: 1.75
* Protobuf 3.17.3 or later

You can also install the database with cargo:

```
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
cargo install reductstore
RS_DATA_PATH=./data reductstore
```

## Azure Virtual Machine

ReductStore is available as an Azure Virtual Machine on the [**Azure Marketplace**](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en/marketplace/apps/reductsoftware.reductstore-server).
The virtual machine is pre-configured with ReductStore and all the necessary dependencies to store data in Azure storage accounts.
Read more about the deployment in the [**Azure Virtual Machine guide**](../guides/integration/azure-vm.mdx).


## Snap

You can install the database with snap:

```
sudo snap install reductstore
```

ReductStore will be available on port http://127.0.01:8383 and store data in the `/var/snap/reductstore/common/data` directory.

### Demo Server

If you don't want to deal with the installation, but just want to play with the database, you can use our demo server:

URL: [**https://play.reduct.store**](https://play.reduct.store)

API Token: reductstore

## What Is Next?

Try to use the database with your favorite programming language:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

If you can't find your programming language in the list, you can still use [**the ReductStore HTTP API**](http-api/) or ping us. If you are serious about using it, we can help you with integration.
