## Installing the JavaScript SDK

<InstallSdk>
    To install the SDK, you will need only `npm` or `yarn`. You can install the SDK by running the following
    command:

    ```
    npm install reduct-js
    ```
</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create the client, you can use the `Client` class from the `reduct-js` package. Pass the URL of the
    ReductStore instance you wish to connect to as an argument to the `Client` constructor.

    ```javascript file=../examples/js/src/quick_start.mjs start=1. end=2.
    ```
</CreateClientSection>

## Creating a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>
    To create a bucket, you should use the `getOrCreateBucket` method on a `Client` instance. Pass the name of the
    bucket you want to create as an argument, along with settings. If the bucket already exists, the `getOrCreateBucket`
    method will return it.

    ```javascript file=../examples/js/src/quick_start.mjs start=2. end=3.
    ```
</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped record to an entry in a bucket, you should use the `beginWrite` method on a `Bucket` object.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument, along with the data and timestamp you want to write.
    The `beginWrite` method will create the `sensor-1` entry if it doesn't exist and return a `WritableRecord` object.
    The `WritableRecord` object can be used to send the data to the database.

    ```javascript file=../examples/js/src/quick_start.mjs start=3. end=4.
    ```

    Pay attention that the time is a UNIX time in microseconds. This the reason why we use BigInt to represent it.
</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the entry to iterate over, and `start` and `stop` arguments to specify the time interval. The `query`
    method returns an async iterator over the records in the entry:

    ```javascript file=../examples/js/src/quick_start.mjs start=4.
    ```
</DataQueryingSection>
