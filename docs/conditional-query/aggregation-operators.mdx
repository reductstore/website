The aggregation operators are used to aggregate data in a **[conditional query](../glossary#conditional-query)**.

The following aggregation operators are supported:

| Operator  | Description                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `$each_n` | Keeps each N-th record after previous condition |

## $each_n

The `$each_n` operator is used to keep each N-th record after the previous condition.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$each_n": [
    { <expression as integer> }
  ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression as an integer and uses it to determine the step size for keeping records.

### Examples

Array notation:

```json
{
  "&score": { "$gt": 10 },
  "$each_n": [5] // Keep every 5th record whose score is greater than 10
}
```
