The logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a query.

The following logical operators are supported:

| Operator             | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$and` \| `$all_of`  | Logical AND operator. For result to be true, all conditions must be true.        |
| `$or` \| `$any_of`   | Logical OR operator. For result to be true, at least one condition must be true. |
| `$not` \| `$none_of` | Logical NOT operator. For result to be true, all conditions must be false.       |
| `$xor` \| `$one_of`  | Logical XOR operator. For result to be true, exactly one condition must be true. |

## $and | $all_of

The `$and` or `$all_of` operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a query. The result is true only if all conditions are true.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$and" | "$all_of: [
    { expression_1 },
    { expression_2},
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates each condition in the array and returns true only if all conditions are true.
It stops evaluating conditions as soon as one of them is false.
Empty list of conditions is always true.

### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "&label_name_1": { "$and": "&label_name_2" }
}
```

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$all_of": [
    { "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 } },
    { "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 } }
  ]
}
```

## $or | $any_of

The `$or` or `$any_of` operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a query. The result is true if at least one condition is true.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$or" | "$any_of": [
    { expression_1 },
    { expression_2},
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates each condition in the array and returns true if at least one condition is true.
It stops evaluating conditions as soon as one of them is true. Empty list of conditions is always false.

### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "&label_name_1": { "$or": "&label_name_2" }
}
```

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$any_of": [
    { "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 } },
    { "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 } }
  ]
}
```

## $not | $none_of

The `$not` or `$none_of` operator is used to negate a condition in a query. The result is true only if all conditions are false.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$not" | "$none_of": [
    { expression_1 },
    { expression_2 },
  ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates each condition in the array and returns true only if all conditions are false.
It stops evaluating conditions as soon as one of them is true. Empty list of conditions is always true.

### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "&label_name_1": { "$not": "&label_name_2" }
}
```

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$none_of": [
    { "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 } },
    { "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 } }
  ]
}
```

## $xor | $one_of

The `$xor` or `$one_of` operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a query. The result is true only if exactly one condition is true.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$xor" | "$one_of": [
    { expression_1 },
    { expression_2 },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates each condition in the array and returns true only if exactly one condition is true.
It stops evaluating conditions as soon as more than one of them is true. Empty list of conditions is always false.

### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "&label_name_1": { "$xor": "&label_name_2" }
}
```

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$one_of": [
    { "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 } },
    { "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 } }
  ]
}
```
