Besides the main categories of operators, ReductStore supports a few miscellaneous operators that provide additional functionality:

| Operator              | Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$has` \| `$exists`   | Checks if a record has specific labels.                             |
| `$cast`               | Casts a label value to a different type explicitly.                 |
| `$ref`                | References a label value in a record explicitly.                    |
| `$timestamp` \| `$id` | Retrieves the timestamp of a record as a UNIX time in microseconds. |

## $has | $exists

The `$has` or `$exists` operator is used to check if a [**record**](../glossary#record) has specific [**labels**](../glossary#label).

The operator is useful when you want to filter records based on the presence of a label, regardless of its value.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$has" | "$exists" : [ <expression as label reference>, ... ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates expressions as strings and checks if the record has all the specified labels.

Additional rules:

- If the expression is not a string, it is cast to a string.
- The operator is case-sensitive.
- The evaluation stops as soon as one of the labels is not found.

### Examples

Check if a record has labels `label_1` and `label_2`:

```json
{
  "$has": ["label_1", "label_2"]
}
```

## $cast

The `$cast` operator is used to cast a label value to a different type explicitly.

The condition query engine automatically casts values to the correct type when comparing them, but sometimes you may want to cast a value explicitly.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$cast": [ <expression as label reference>, <"bool" | "int" | "float" | "string" | "duration"> ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression then casts the value to the specified type in the second argument.
Supported types are: `bool`, `int`, `float`, `string`, and `duration`. See the **[casting rules](./#type-casting)** for more details.


### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "$label_name": {
    "$cast": "int"
  }
}
```

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$cast": ["&label_name", "int"]
}
```

## $ref

The `$ref` operator is used to reference a label value in a record explicitly.

This is equivalent to using the label reference "&" in the query object, however, it allows you to use expressions to reference labels.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$ref": [ <expression as label reference> ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression as a string and references the label value in the record.

### Examples

Simple reference to a label:

```json
{
  "$ref": ["label_name"]
}
```

Using an expression to reference a label:

```json
{
  "$ref": [{ "$add": ["label_", "name"] }]
}
```

## $timestamp | $id

The `$timestamp` operator is used to retrieve the timestamp of a record as a UNIX time in microseconds.
The operator is useful when you want to filter records based on their timestamp or when you want to use the timestamp in calculations.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$timestamp": []
}
```

### Behavior

The operator is a nullary operator that returns the timestamp of the record as a UNIX time in microseconds.

### Examples

Retrieve a certain record by its timestamp:

```json
{
  "$timestamp": { "$eq": 1672531199000 }
}
```

Retrieve multiple records by their timestamps:

```json
{
  "$in": ["$timestamp", 1672531199000, 1672531200000]
}
```
