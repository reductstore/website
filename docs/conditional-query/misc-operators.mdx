Besides the main categories of operators, ReductStore supports a few miscellaneous operators that provide additional functionality:

| Operator  | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `$exists` | Checks if a label exists in a record.               |
| `$cast`   | Casts a label value to a different type explicitly. |
| `$ref`    | References a label value in a record explicitly.    |

## $exists

The `$exists` operator is used to check if a [**label**](../glossary#label) exists in a [**record**](../glossary#record).

The operator is useful when you want to filter records based on the presence of a label, regardless of its value.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$exists": [ <expression as label reference> ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression as a string and checks if the label exists in the record.

Additional rules:

- If the expression is not a string, it is cast to a string.
- The operator is case-sensitive.

### Examples

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$exists": ["label_name"]
}
```

## $cast

The `$cast` operator is used to cast a label value to a different type explicitly.

The condition query engine automatically casts values to the correct type when comparing them, but sometimes you may want to cast a value explicitly.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$cast": [ <expression as label reference>, <"bool" | "int" | "float" | "string"> ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression then casts the value to the specified type in the second argument.

Supported types:

- `bool`: Casts the value to a boolean.
- `int`: Casts the value to an integer.
- `float`: Casts the value to a float.
- `string`: Casts the value to a string.

### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "$cast": {
    "&label_name": "int"
  }
}
```

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$cast": ["&label_name", "int"]
}
```

## $ref

The `$ref` operator is used to reference a label value in a record explicitly.

This is equivalent to using the label reference "&" in the query object, however, it allows you to use expressions to reference labels.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$ref": [ <expression as label reference> ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression as a string and references the label value in the record.

### Examples

Simple reference to a label:

```json
{
  "$ref": ["label_name"]
}
```

Using an expression to reference a label:

```json
{
  "$ref": [{ "$concat": ["label_", "name"] }]
}
```
