The string operators are used to filter records based on string values of their labels.

The following string operators are supported:

| Operator       | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `$contains`    | Checks if a string contains a substring.    |
| `$starts_with` | Checks if a string starts with a substring. |
| `$ends_with`   | Checks if a string ends with a substring.   |

## $contains

The `$contains` operator is used to check if a string contains a substring.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$contains": [ <expression as string>, <expression as substring> ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression as a string and checks if it contains the second expression as a substring.

Additional rules:

- If the first expression is not a string, it is cast to a string.
- If the second expression is not a string, it is cast to a string.
- The operator is case-sensitive.

### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "&name": { "$contains": "bottle" }
}
```

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$contains": ["&name", "bottle"]
}
```

## $starts_with

The `$starts_with` operator is used to check if a string starts with a substring.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$starts_with": [ <expression as string>, <expression as substring> ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression as a string and checks if it starts with the second expression as a substring.

Additional rules:

- If the first expression is not a string, it is cast to a string.
- If the second expression is not a string, it is cast to a string.
- The operator is case-sensitive.

### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "&name": { "$starts_with": "red" }
}
```

Array notation:

```json
{
  "$starts_with": ["&name", "red"]
}
```

## $ends_with

The `$ends_with` operator is used to check if a string ends with a substring.

### Syntax

```
{
  "$ends_with": [ <expression as string>, <expression as substring> ]
}
```

### Behavior

The operator evaluates the first expression as a string and checks if it ends with the second expression as a substring.

Additional rules:

- If the first expression is not a string, it is cast to a string.
- If the second expression is not a string, it is cast to a string.
- The operator is case-sensitive.

### Examples

Object notation:

```json
{
  "&name": { "$ends_with": "store" }
}
```
