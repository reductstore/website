Conditional Query is a query language based on JSON syntax that allows you to filter records in ReductStore using labels and their values.

The query language is used in the [**query endpoint**](../http-api/entry-api/run_query.mdx) of the **[HTTP API](./glossary#http-api)**.
You can also find usage examples with many SDKs and tools in the [**Data Querying**](../guides/data-querying.mdx) and
in the [**Data Management**](../guides/data-management.mdx) guides.

## Query Syntax

The query object is a JSON object containing one or more conditions, a condition can be nested and have a tree-like structure.
Queries can be written in two main notations: object notation and array notation. Each has its own strengths and trade-offs.
In addition, a special naming convention is used to extend the JSON syntax.

### Object notation

A condition is a key-value pair, where the key is the label reference and the value is an object with the operator and operand.
For example, to filter records where the value of the `label_name` is greater than 10:

```json
{
  "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 }
}
```

The object notation is the most common and easiest to read and write, but it has the limitation that you can't have more than two operands in a condition, and the first must be the label reference.

### Array notation

A condition is a key-value pair where the key is the operator and the value is an array with its operands:

```json
{
  "$gt": ["&label_name", 10]
}
```

The array notation is more flexible and allows you to have more than two operands in a condition:

```json
{
  "$and": [
    { "&x": { "$gt": 10 } },
    { "&y": { "$lt": 20 } },
    { "&z": { "$eq": 30 } }
  ]
}
```

For unary operators the array can be replaced with a single value:

```json
{
  "$not": "&label_name"
}
```

### Multiple conditions

The query object can contain multiple conditions that are linked using the AND operator:

```json
{
  "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 },
  "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 }
}
```

This is the same as:

```json
{
  "$and": [{ "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 } }, { "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 } }]
}
```

The conditions are evaluated in the order they are defined, and the result is true only if all conditions are true.
By default, a condition is evaluated at the stage of data retrieval, so the query engine will not read the record if the condition is false.

However, if a condition has a [**computed label**](./glossary#computed-label), the engine will check the condition after the record has been read and processed by [**extensions**](./glossary#extension).
For example, if you have a condition like this:

```json
{
  "&object_number": { "$gt": 10 },
  "@anomaly_score": { "$gt": 0.5 }
}
```

The engine will read the record that matches the first condition, but it will not check the second condition until the record is processed by the extension that computes the `@anomaly_score` label.

### JSON Extension

The queries use a special naming convention for labels and operators to extend the JSON syntax with additional functionality:

| Type           | Convention    | Description                                                                      |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Label          | "&label_name" | Reference to a label in the **[record](./glossary#record)** starting with `&`    |
| Computed Label | "@label_name" | Reference to a **[computed label](./glossary#computed-label)** starting with `@` |
| Directive      | "#directive"  | Reference to a **[directive](./glossary#directive)** starting with `#`            |
| Operator       | "$operator"   | Reference to an operator starting with `$`                                       |
| Constant       | JSON types    | A constant value in the query, e.g. `10`, `"string"`                             |

## Type System

### Supported Types

The **[conditional query](./glossary#conditional-query)** language supports a simple type system with five types: **boolean**, **integer**, **float**, **string**, and **duration**:

| Type     | Size (bytes) | Description                                                              |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| boolean  | 1            | Represents logical values `true` or `false`                              |
| integer  | 8            | 64-bit signed integer                                                    |
| float    | 8            | 64-bit IEEE-754 double-precision floating-point number                   |
| string   | 1â€“65,536     | UTF-8 encoded string                                                     |
| duration | 8            | 64-bit signed integer representing microseconds (e.g., `1s = 1,000,000`) |

#### Boolean

The boolean type represents logical values and can be either `true` or `false`.
Used in logical conditions and operators like `$and` and `$not`.

- **Literals:** `true`, `false`

#### Integer

The integer type is a signed 64-bit integer, used for numeric operations and conditions that require whole numbers.

- **Literals:** `10`, `-5`, `0`

#### Float

The float type is a double-precision floating-point number, used for numeric operations and conditions that require decimal values.

- **Literals:** `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.71828`

#### String

The string type is a UTF-8 encoded sequence of characters, used for text operations and conditions.

- **Literals:** `"hello"`, `"ReductStore"`, `"123"`

#### Duration

The duration type represents a time interval in microseconds and is stored as a signed 64-bit integer.
It is used in time-based operations such as `$each_t` or arithmetic comparisons.

- **Literals:** `-1s`, `1.5s`, `1d 2h`
- **Units:** `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days)

Multiple units can be combined (e.g., 1h 30m).

### Type Inference

The query engine stores label values as strings without any type information. The query engine attempts to infer the type of a label value as follows:

1. If the value is `true` or `false`, it is interpreted as a boolean.
2. If the value is a number without a decimal point, it is interpreted as an integer.
3. If the value is a number with a decimal point, it is interpreted as a float.
4. If none of the above apply, the value is interpreted as a string.

:::info
The `duration` type is **not** inferred from label values. It must be used as a constant literal.
:::

### Type Casting

During the execution of the query, the engine will try to cast types of operands to the same type.
Logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, `$not` will cast the result to a boolean.
Comparison and arithmetic operators will cast the operands to the most precise type in the following order:

|              | boolean               | integer          | duration              | float               | string |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| **boolean**  | boolean               | integer (0 or 1) | duration (0us or 1us) | float ( 0.0 or 1.0) | -      |
| **integer**  | integer (0 or 1)      | integer          | integer               | float               | -      |
| **duration** | duration (0us or 1us) | integer          | duration              | float               | -      |
| **float**    | float (0.0 or 1.0)    | float            | float                 | float               | -      |
| **string**   | -                     | -                | -                     | -                   | string |
