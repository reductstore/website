Conditional Query is a query language based on JSON syntax that allows you to filter records in ReductStore using labels and their values.

The query language is used in the [**query endpoint**](../http-api/entry-api/run_query.mdx) of the **[HTTP API](./glossary#http-api)**.
You can also find usage examples with many SDKs and tools in the [**Data Querying**](../guides/data-querying.mdx) and
in the [**Data Management**](../guides/data-management.mdx) guides.

## Query Syntax

The query object is a JSON object containing one or more conditions, a condition can be nested and have a tree-like structure.
Queries can be written in two main notations: object notation and array notation. Each has its own strengths and trade-offs.
In addition, a special naming convention is used to extend the JSON syntax.

### Object notation

A condition is a key-value pair, where the key is the label reference and the value is an object with the operator and operand.
For example, to filter records where the value of the `label_name` is greater than 10:

```json
{
  "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 }
}
```

The object notation is the most common and easiest to read and write, but it has the limitation that you can't have more than two operands in a condition, and the first must be the label reference.

### Array notation

A condition is a key-value pair where the key is the operator and the value is an array with its operands:

```json
{
  "$gt": ["&label_name", 10]
}
```

The array notation is more flexible and allows you to have more than two operands in a condition:

```json
{
  "$and": [
    { "&x": { "$gt": 10 } },
    { "&y": { "$lt": 20 } },
    { "&z": { "$eq": 30 } }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple conditions

The query object can contain multiple conditions that are linked using the AND operator:

```json
{
  "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 },
  "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 }
}
```

This is the same as:

```json
{
  "$and": [{ "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 } }, { "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 } }]
}
```

The conditions are evaluated in the order they are defined, and the result is true only if all conditions are true.
By default, a condition is evaluated at the stage of data retrieval, so the storage engine will not read the record if the condition is false.

However, if a condition has a [**computed label**](./glossary#computed-label), the engine will check the condition after the record has been read and processed by [**extensions**](./glossary#extensions).
For example, if you have a condition like this:

```javascript
{
  "&object_number": { "$gt": 10 },
  "@anomaly_score": { "$gt": 0.5 }
}
```

The engine will read the record that matches the first condition, but it will not check the second condition until the record is processed by the extension that computes the `@anomaly_score` label.

### JSON Extension

The queries use a special naming convention for labels and operators to extend the JSON syntax with additional functionality:

| Type           | Convention    | Description                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Label          | "&label_name" | Reference to a label in the **[record](./glossary#record)** starting with `&`    |
| Computed Label | "@label_name" | Reference to a **[computed label](./glossary#computed-label)** starting with `@` |
| Operator       | "$operator"   | Reference to an operator starting with `$`                                       |
| Constant       | JSON types    | A constant value in the query, e.g. `10`, `"string"`                             |

## Type System

### Supported Types

The **[conditional query](./glossary#conditional-query)** language supports a simple type system with four types: **boolean**, **integer**, **float**, and **string**:

| Type    | Size   | Description                                     |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| boolean | 1      | Boolean value can be `true` or `false`          |
| integer | 8      | Signed 64-bit integer                           |
| float   | 8      | IEEE-754 double-precision floating-point number |
| string  | 1-2^16 | UTF-8 encoded string                            |

### Type Inference

The storage engine stores a label as a string without any type information, so the query engine tries to infer the type of the label based on its value:

1. If a label has a value of true or false, it is converted to a boolean.
2. If a label has a number without a decimal point, it is converted to an integer.
3. If a label has a number with a decimal point, it is converted to a float.
4. If all other conversions fail, it is converted to a string.

### Type Casting

During the execution of the query, the engine will try to cast types of operands to the same type.
Logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, `$not` will cast the result to a boolean.
Comparison and arithmetic operators will cast the operands to the most precise type in the following order:

|             | boolean | integer                         | float                             | string |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| **boolean** | boolean | integer (false -> 0, true -> 1) | float (false -> 0.0, true -> 1.0) | -      |
| **integer** | integer | integer                         | float                             | -      |
| **float**   | float   | float                           | float                             | -      |
| **string**  | -       | -                               | -                                 | string |

There are some exceptions to this rule, read **[the arithmetic operator documentation](./arithmetic-operators.mdx)** for more information.

## Operators

The conditional query language supports many operators for comparison, arithmetic, and logical operations.
