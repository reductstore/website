Robotics teams today wrestle with data that grows faster than their infrastructure. Every robot generates streams of images, sensor readings, logs, and events in different formats. These data piles are fragmented, expensive to move, and slow to analyze. Teams often rely on generic cloud tools that are not built for robotics. They charge way too much per gigabyte (when it should cost little per terabyte), hide the raw data behind proprietary APIs, and make it hard for robots (and developers) to access or use their own data.

ReductStore introduces a new category: a database purpose built for robotics data pipelines. It is open, efficient, and developer friendly. It lets teams store, query, and manage any time series of unstructured data directly from robots to the cloud.

## What Makes It a New Category

ReductStore treats robotics with the respect it deserves. It captures everything in its raw form and stores it with a time index and labels for flexible querying and management. It ingests and streams any type of data (images, sensor frames, logs, ROS bag topics, CSVs, JSON, etc) without forcing developers to convert or reformat it. 

It works on robots and in the cloud using the same interface. Developers can run ReductStore on an edge device for local data capture and replicate to an S3 backend for cloud analytics or archiving. It becomes the missing layer between the robot and the observability stack.

## Data Handling and Querying

Developers can work directly with data using simple queries and SDKs. The focus is speed and flexibility.

### 1. MCAP topic filtering

You can filter topics directly when uploading or streaming data from a ROS bag.

{/* TODO: example MCAP */}

This allows you to extract only the relevant topics from multiple bags without needing to download and reprocess everything locally.

### 2. JSON field and CSV column filtering

You can filter JSON fields and CSV columns when querying data. This means you can select only the specific fields you care about. For example, you can extract only the odometry coordinates from a stream of JSON or CSV sensor readings.

{/* TODO: example JSON and CSV filtering */}

### 3. Query any type of data

ReductStore automatically batches small records and streams large ones for efficient storage and access. You can query any type of data, from lightweight telemetry to high-resolution images or point clouds, efficiently.

{/* example images */}

### 4. Browse petabytes of data

ReductStore is designed to handle massive volumes of data. Its indexing and storage architecture allows you to efficiently browse and query petabytes of robotics data with iterative queries.

{/* TODO: example of web console time range and zooming */}

You can build custom applications on top of ReductStore using its SDKs for Python, C++, Rust, Javascript, and Go. This makes it easy to build data pipelines, dashboards that works in the browser, or integrate with existing tools.

## Cloud Integration and Cost Efficiency

ReductStore connects robots and the cloud in a simple, flexible way. It supports S3 compatible storage backends and includes a robust replication system that reliably transfers data from robots to the cloud, even when networks are unstable.

{/* TODO: diagram of blocks in S3 backend */}

Its architecture is designed to minimize cloud storage usage. By batching records, it reduces the number of stored objects and lowers costs. This approach can deliver major savings when working with large volumes of robotics data.

## Observability Stack Integration

ReductStore works with the tools robotics engineers already trust.

### Foxglove

Foxglove is an amazing tool for visualizing robotics data and debugging robots for the MCAP format. 

To share data from ReductStore to Foxglove, you can use the ReductStore web console (or with the SDKs) to generate a shared link that Foxglove can open directly.

{/* TODO: create shared link with web console and Foxglove */}

### Grafana

Grafana is a popular open-source tool for creating dashboards and visualising time-series data. You can connect Grafana to ReductStore using the ReductStore data source plugin, which allows you to query and visualise data stored in ReductStore directly from Grafana.

{/* TODO: example query JSON content and labels from Grafana */}

### Canonical

Canonical's COS (Canonical Observability Stack) for robotics is an end to end observability framework built on open source tools such as Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, and Foxglove.

The missing piece in this stack has always been a purpose built system for storing and managing raw robotics data efficiently (from robot to cloud).

{/* TODO: diagram integration with COS; agent, local robot, database */}

ReductStore closes that gap. It provides databases optimized for both edge and cloud environments, along with an agent that captures data directly from ROS and streams it into the observability pipeline.

{/* TODO: COS catalogue with ReductStore */}

## Closing Thoughts

Robotics teams no longer need to choose between control and convenience. ReductStore gives full ownership of data from robot to cloud. It removes vendor lock, cuts cost, and keeps everything observable and connected. It is the new foundation for robotics data infrastructure (the missing database for robotics).

If you are interested to compare ReductStore with other databases (like MongoDB or InfluxDB), you can read our [**white paper**](/whitepaper) that goes deeper into the architecture and design choices.
