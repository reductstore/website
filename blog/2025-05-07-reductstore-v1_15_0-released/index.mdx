![ReductStore v1.15.0 Released](./img/banner_release_1_15.webp)

We are pleased to announce the release of the latest minor version of [**ReductStore**](/), [**1.15.0**](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/releases/tag/v1.15.0). ReductStore is a time series database designed for storing and managing large amounts of blob data.

To download the latest released version, please visit our [**Download Page**](/download).

## What's new in 1.15.0?

This release introduces several new features and enhancements, including extension API, improved Web Console, and new conditional query operators.

### Extension API

ReductStore is blob storage essentially, it doesn't know anything about the data it stores. We really want to keep it that way because
it allows to ingest and query data in any format with the best performance. But we also understand that sometimes you need to do some processing on the data before or after storing it.
For example if you ingest data in JSON format, you may want to query only some fields of the JSON object or use it in the query condition for filtering.
With the new extension API it's possible.

The extension API is experimental and is not yet documented. We started developing extensions for columnar data CSV and mcap formats, and
when we gain enough experience with it, we will document the API and publish the extensions so that you can build your own extensions for your data formats.

For most curious users, you can see a demo extension that scale JPEG images on the fly on GitHub: https://github.com/reductstore/img-ext

### Improved Web Console

In the v1.14.0 release we introduced the ability to browse data in the Web Console. In this release we added the ability to upload files to the database and update labels in the Web Console.

The upload feature can be used to upload some artifacts manually e.g. AI models or configuration files.

With the update labels feature you can label your data directly in the Web Console or correct the labels of the data you uploaded.

### New Conditional Query Operators

We expanded the set of conditional query operators with new ones that allow you to filter and aggregate data more effectively:

- `$each_n` - keeps only every N-th record in the result set.
- `$each_t` - keeps only one record within given time period in seconds.
- `$limit` - limits the number of records in the result set.
- `$timestamp` - allows to filter records by timestamp.

The `$timestamp` might be especially useful if you store timestamps and metadata in other database and want to retrieve blobs from ReductStore:

```python

client = Client("http://localhost:8080")
bucket = await client.get("my_bucket")
async for record in bucket.query(start=1231231081, end=1231231085,
    when ={
        "$in": [
            "$timestamp",
            1231231081,
            1231231082,
            1231231083,
            1231231084,
        ]
    },
):
    content = await record.read_all()

```

Read more about the new operators in the [**Conditional Query**](/docs/conditional-query) documentation.

## What next?

We are continuously working on improving ReductStore and adding new features to deliver the best experience for our users. In the next releases we are planning to add
new features and improvements, including:

### Integration with ROS

ReductStore is a great fit for storing and managing large amounts of data in robotics applications. We are working on integrating ReductStore with ROS to provide a seamless experience for storing and retrieving data in ROS applications.
We launched a new [**ROS2 agent**](https://github.com/reductstore/ros2-reduct-agent) that allows you to store and retrieve data in ReductStore from ROS2 applications. The agent is designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing ROS2 applications.
We are also working on the support for mcap format that will allow to retrieve data in the original format from mcap files, filter topics and many other features.

### Golang SDK

Our big goal is Grafana integration by the end of 2025. This month we have started working on the Golang SDK that is the first step to achieve this goal.
The project is in the early stages of development, but you can already check it out on GitHub: [**ReductStore Golang SDK**](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-go).

I hope you find those new features useful. If you have any questions or feedback, donâ€™t hesitate to use the [**ReductStore Community**](https://community.reduct.store/signup) forum.

Thanks for using [**ReductStore**](/)!
