## Shop Floor Data Acquisition System

1. Edge device close to the machine and sensors
2. Connectors to collect data and ingest it into ReductStore

Advantages of using ReductStore for DAQ:

1. FIFO quota for data storage
2. Fast data ingestion
3. Data labeling and annotation

Replicating data:

1. Append-only replication works like streaming
2. Data reduction based on the label
3. Resilient to network failures

## Factory Data Acquisition System

Factory instancee:

1. Collect data from multiple machines
2. Sends data to the cloud
3. Provide access to the raw data for the data scientists and engineers

Advantages of using ReductStore:

1. Quick data access
2. Data management based on the label

## Cloud Data Acquisition System

1. Data ingestion from multiple factories
2. Fully managed data storage
3. Using cloud blob storage for long-term storage
4. Subscription-based data access for ETL

## Conclusion

ReductStore is useful on each level of the data acquistion. You can use it only on the edge device, or on the factory level, or on the cloud level. It provides a fast and reliable way to collect and store data from the shop floor.
