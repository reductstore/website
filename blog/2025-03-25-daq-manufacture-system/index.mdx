Large manufacturing plants generate vast amounts of data from machines and sensors.
This data is valuable for monitoring machine health, predicting failures, and optimizing production. It also serves as a foundation for building industrial AI models for predictive maintenance, quality control, and process optimization.

A **Data Acquisition (DAQ)** system collects this data, processes it, and stores it for further analysis.
It typically consists of edge devices that gather real-time data, central servers or cloud storage for retention, and software that enables analytics and AI-driven insights.

Traditional automation solutions like SCADA and historians are complex, expensive, and not optimized for modern cloud-based AI applications.
They often limit access to data, making it difficult for engineers and data scientists to develop machine learning models and gain actionable insights.

In this article, we’ll explore the challenges of building a modern DAQ system for manufacturing and how ReductStore can simplify the process and
support **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflows** for advanced analytics and **AI application**s.

In the 21st century, manufacturing is becoming increasingly data-driven. While many factories are already equipped with automation systems, SCADA systems, and historians that collect data from machines and sensors, these solutions have limitations when it comes to modern data needs.

Key challenges include:

- **Capturing high-frequency data** – Traditional systems struggle with data-intensive sources like vibration analysis and video monitoring.
- **Enabling easy access** – Data scientists and engineers need standardized, open access to raw and processed data for advanced analytics and AI applications.
- **Supporting cloud-based storage and processing** – Legacy systems are not designed for seamless integration with cloud platforms, limiting scalability and accessibility.

This is where a dedicated Data Acquisition (DAQ) system comes in.
A DAQ system efficiently collects, processes, and stores manufacturing data, providing real-time access for **optimization and predictive analytics**.
It consists of:

- **Edge devices** that gather real-time data from machines and sensors.
- **Central servers** and cloud storage that manage and store data securely.
- **Software** that processes, analyzes, and makes the data accessible for further insights.

Importantly, implementing a DAQ system does not mean replacing existing automation infrastructure. In many cases, DAQ systems are deployed alongside SCADA and historians, complementing them rather than replacing them.

## Challenges of Building a DAQ System

DAQ systems are often perceived as simpler and more cost-effective than full-scale automation solutions. However, designing a robust DAQ system for manufacturing comes with its own set of challenges:

- **Handling Massive Data Volume and Velocity** – Manufacturing plants generate vast amounts of high-frequency data from machines and sensors. Efficiently collecting, processing, and storing this data in real-time requires a scalable architecture.
- **Ensuring Reliable Connectivity with Low Latency** – Edge devices must transmit data to central servers or cloud storage with minimal latency and high reliability, even in industrial environments with network constraints.
- **Maintaining Data Security and Privacy** – Manufacturing data is often sensitive, requiring strong encryption, access controls, and compliance with industry regulations to prevent unauthorized access or breaches.
- **Balancing Cost and Scalability** – As data volume grows, the DAQ system must scale efficiently without excessive costs, requiring optimized storage, compression techniques, and cloud integration.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how ReductStore can simplify the process of building a DAQ system for manufacturing.

A DAQ system can range from a single edge device near a machine to a complex infrastructure spanning multiple factories and cloud instances.
Below is a high-level overview of its structure:

## Shop Floor

The **shop floor** is where the manufacturing process takes place, and it is the closest point to the machines and sensors that generate data.
Due to the real-time nature of manufacturing data, it is crucial to have edge devices positioned near the machines to collect and transmit data efficiently.

Edge devices can either process data locally or act as **FIFO buffers**, temporarily storing data before sending it to the next level of the system.
Their role depends on system requirements, but their primary function is to ensure seamless data acquisition without overloading the network or losing critical information.

### Data Ingestion

Industrial data comes in a variety of formats and frequencies.
A DAQ system must support ingestion from multiple sources such as **sensors, PLCs, and cameras**.
Since manufacturing environments rely on diverse industrial protocols, custom connectors are often required to collect data efficiently:

- **OPC-UA** – A widely used standard for industrial automation that allows seamless data retrieval from automation systems.
- **IO-Link** – A point-to-point communication protocol for sensors and actuators, commonly used for smart and vibration sensors.
- **GenICam** – A standard for machine vision, enabling data collection from cameras and vision systems.

By leveraging standard protocols, a DAQ system remains flexible and scalable, allowing integration with various industrial devices.

However, raw data collected from these sources is often **unstructured and storage-intensive**, requiring effective processing and retention strategies.

### Efficient Data Storage with ReductStore

Data storage in a DAQ system must handle diverse data types and support real-time ingestion.
Additionally, edge devices have **limited storage**, meaning the system cannot afford to stop data collection when storage is full.

ReductStore solves these challenges by providing a unified data storage solution optimized for manufacturing environments:

- **High-Speed Ingestion** – Designed for fast, real-time data collection from multiple sources.
- **FIFO Quotas** – Automatically deletes old data when storage is full, ensuring continuous operation without manual intervention.
- **Data Labeling** – Enables structured organization by tagging data based on source, type, or timestamp, making retrieval and analysis more efficient.

Data labeling is particularly useful for structuring information. For instance, video data can be labeled with machine states (e.g., running, stopped, fault), making it easy to filter and retrieve condition-specific records.

### Data Replication

In most cases, **edge devices serve as temporary storage** before data is transferred to a **central server or cloud storage** for long-term retention and further analysis. However, manufacturing environments introduce several connectivity challenges:

- **Unstable or slow networks** – Many edge devices rely on Wi-Fi or LTE, where connections can be unreliable.
- **Limited bandwidth** – Efficient data transfer must be prioritized to avoid network congestion.
- **Remote locations** – Some edge devices may not always have direct internet access.

Unlike traditional **IoT protocols like MQTT**, using a **database for streaming data** ensures persistence and reliability—data is stored on disk and can be replicated even after extended connection losses.

### ReductStore’s Reliable Replication Model

ReductStore is designed to handle these industrial constraints with robust replication capabilities:

- **Push Replication** – Edge devices push data to the central server/cloud only when a connection is available, eliminating the need for a permanent connection.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Support** – Ensures compatibility with firewalls and industrial network configurations.
- **Batch Replication** – Sends multiple records in a single request, optimizing bandwidth usage and reducing network overhead.
- **Selective Replication** – Replicates only necessary data based on labels, timestamps, or other conditions, optimizing network traffic and storage costs.

With ReductStore, setting up replication requires no custom logic—simply label your data, define replication conditions, and the system handles the rest. This approach ensures efficient, cost-effective, and scalable data acquisition for manufacturing environments.

## Factory Storage System

The next level of the DAQ system is the factory storage system. It receives data from multiple edge devices and provides access to the raw data for data scientists and engineers.
In the contrast to the edge device, here we can have more powerful hardware and storage, and we can store the data for a longer period of time.
The factory storage system can be a server, NAS or SAN storage.

The data engineers can access the data, process it, and prepare it for further analysis they can also manage the data retention policies and access control.

On this level, we can use ReductStore as a data storage solution that provides fast and reliable access to the raw data:

- **Fast Data Retrieval** – ReductStore is optimized for fast data retrieval, enabling data engineers to access and process raw data efficiently.
- **Data Labeling and Filtering** – ReductStore allows to label data based on the source, type, or timestamp, making it easy to filter and retrieve data for analysis.
- **SDKs and APIs** – ReductStore provides SDKs and APIs for popular programming languages enabling data engineers to integrate data processing workflows with their preferred tools and frameworks.

## Cloud Data Acquisition System

1. Data ingestion from multiple factories
2. Fully managed data storage
3. Using cloud blob storage for long-term storage
4. Subscription-based data access for ETL

## Conclusion

ReductStore is useful on each level of the data acquistion. You can use it only on the edge device, or on the factory level, or on the cloud level. It provides a fast and reliable way to collect and store data from the shop floor.
