Large manufacturing plants generate vast amounts of data from machines and sensors.
This data is valuable for monitoring machine health, predicting failures, and optimizing production. It also serves as a foundation for building industrial AI models for predictive maintenance, quality control, and process optimization.

A **Data Acquisition (DAQ)** system collects this data, processes it, and stores it for further analysis.
It typically consists of edge devices that gather real-time data, central servers or cloud storage for retention, and software that enables analytics and AI-driven insights.

Traditional automation solutions like SCADA and historians are complex, expensive, and not optimized for modern cloud-based AI applications.
They often limit access to data, making it difficult for engineers and data scientists to develop machine learning models and gain actionable insights.

In this article, we’ll explore the challenges of building a modern DAQ system for manufacturing and how ReductStore can simplify the process and
support **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflows** for advanced analytics and **AI application**s.

## The Role of DAQ Systems in Manufacturing

In the 21st century, manufacturing is becoming increasingly data-driven. While many factories are already equipped with automation systems, SCADA systems, and historians that collect data from machines and sensors, these solutions are limited when it comes to today's data needs.

Traditional systems struggle with data-intensive sources such as vibration analysis and video surveillance, which generate **large volumes of unstructured data**.
They don't have interfaces to efficiently access the **history of the raw data**, which is essential for building advanced analytics and AI models.
In addition, they often lack the flexibility to integrate with modern **cloud-based storage** and analytics platforms.

This is where a dedicated data acquisition (DAQ) system comes in.
A DAQ system efficiently collects, processes, and stores manufacturing data, providing real-time access for optimization and predictive analytics.
They are more flexible and scalable than traditional automation solutions and can handle multiple data sources, from sensors and PLCs to cameras and vision systems.

Importantly, implementing a DAQ system does not mean replacing the existing automation infrastructure. In many cases, DAQ systems are deployed alongside SCADA and historians, complementing rather than replacing them.

## Challenges of Building a DAQ System

DAQ systems are often perceived as simpler and more cost-effective than full-scale automation solutions. However, designing a robust DAQ system for manufacturing comes with its own set of challenges:

- **Handling Massive Data Volume and Velocity** – Manufacturing plants generate vast amounts of high-frequency data from machines and sensors. Efficiently collecting, processing, and storing this data in real-time requires a scalable architecture.
- **Ensuring Reliable Connectivity with Low Latency** – Edge devices must transmit data to central servers or cloud storage with minimal latency and high reliability, even in industrial environments with network constraints.
- **Maintaining Data Security and Privacy** – Manufacturing data is often sensitive, requiring strong encryption, access controls, and compliance with industry regulations to prevent unauthorized access or breaches.
- **Balancing Cost and Scalability** – As data volume grows, the DAQ system must scale efficiently without excessive costs, requiring optimized storage, compression techniques, and cloud integration.

With these challenges in mind, let’s explore how ReductStore can simplify the process of building a DAQ system for manufacturing.

A DAQ system can range from a single edge device near a machine to a complex infrastructure spanning multiple factories and cloud instances.
Below is a high-level overview of its structure.

## Shop Floor

The **shop floor** is where the manufacturing process takes place, and it is the closest point to the machines and sensors that generate data.
Due to the real-time nature of manufacturing data, it is crucial to have edge devices positioned near the machines to collect and transmit data efficiently.

Edge devices can either process data locally or act as **FIFO buffers**, temporarily storing data before sending it to the next level of the system.
Their role depends on system requirements, but their primary function is to ensure seamless data acquisition without overloading the network or losing critical information.

### Data Ingestion

Industrial data comes in a variety of formats and frequencies.
A DAQ system must support acquisition from multiple sources such as **sensors, PLCs, and cameras**.
As manufacturing environments rely on various industrial protocols such as OPCUA, IO-Link, and GenICam, the DAQ system must be able to collect data from these sources.
For this purpose, edge devices are equipped with **data connectors** that collect data from different sources and convert it into standardized formats e.g. JSON, CSV, WAV and JPEG.

By using standard protocols, a DAQ system remains flexible and scalable, allowing integration with a variety of industrial devices.
However, the raw data collected from these sources is often **unstructured and storage-intensive**, requiring effective processing and storage strategies.

ReductStore enables the storage of a history of unstructured data and provides an HTTP API and SDKs for multiple programming languages, allowing data connectors to write data in various formats directly to storage.

### Data Storage

Data storage in a DAQ system must handle diverse data types and support real-time ingestion.
Additionally, edge devices have **limited storage**, meaning the system cannot afford to stop data collection when storage is full.

ReductStore solves these challenges by providing a unified data storage solution optimized for manufacturing environments:

- **High-Speed Ingestion** – Designed for fast, real-time data collection from multiple sources.
- **FIFO Quotas** – Automatically deletes old data when storage is full, ensuring continuous operation without manual intervention.
- **Data Labeling** – Enables structured organization by tagging data based on source, type, or timestamp, making retrieval and analysis more efficient.

Data labeling is particularly useful for structuring information. For instance, video data can be labeled with machine states (e.g., running, stopped, fault), making it easy to filter and retrieve condition-specific records.

### Data Replication

In most cases, edge devices serve as temporary storage before data is transferred to a central server or cloud storage for long-term retention and further analysis.

However, manufacturing environments present several connectivity challenges that must be addressed.
One of the most common issues is network reliability.
Edge devices may operate in remote locations with unstable or slow networks, making it difficult to maintain a continuous connection to the central server.
In addition, **limited bandwidth** and **firewall restrictions** can further complicate data transfer.
Security concerns often restrict direct access to edge devices, requiring a more sophisticated replication mechanism.

:::info
Although **IoT protocols such as MQTT** can address many of connectivity issues, using a **database for streaming data** ensures persistence and reliability - data is stored on disk and can be replicated even after prolonged loss of connectivity.
:::

ReductStore is designed to meet these industrial constraints with robust replication capabilities:

- **Push Replication** - Edge devices push data to the central server/cloud only when a connection is available, eliminating the need for a permanent connection and direct access to the edge device.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Support** - Ensures compatibility with firewalls and industrial network configurations.
- **Batch Replication** - Sends multiple records in a single request, optimizing bandwidth usage and reducing network overhead.
- **Conditional Replication** - Replicates only necessary data based on labels, timestamps, or other conditions, optimizing network traffic and storage costs.

With ReductStore, setting up replication requires no custom logic - simply label your data, define replication conditions, and the system does the rest. This approach ensures efficient, cost-effective, and scalable data collection for manufacturing environments.

## Factory Data Store

The **factory storage system** is the next level of the DAQ architecture, responsible for aggregating data from multiple edge devices and providing structured access for data scientists and engineers.

Unlike edge devices, which have limited **processing power and storage**, the factory storage system can leverage more powerful hardware and larger storage capacity, allowing for **longer data retention** and more advanced processing.

### Massive Data Volumes

The factory storage can be a **dedicated server**, **NAS**, or **SAN** optimized for high-throughput data storage.
But independent of the implementation, the storage system must be capable to store **TBs or even PBs** of data because of the high-frequency data generated by manufacturing processes.

:::info
Usually, large amount of unstructured data is stored just in a file system or object storage, which is not optimized for **historical data access**.
:::

ReductStore provides a scalable and efficient storage solution for manufacturing data, designed to handle massive amounts of data.
and ensure fast access to manufacturing data:

- **Indexing by time** - ReductStore indexes data by time, enabling fast retrieval of data over time intervals.
- **Separate storage for metadata** - ReductStore stores and manages metadata separately from data, allowing it to scale and handle more data.
- **Batching** - ReductStore batches data at the communication and file system level, optimizing data storage and access.

### Data Management

When we talked about the need for factory storage to handle massive amounts of data, we meant not only storing the data, but also providing efficient data management.
with access control, data retention policies, and data labeling.

The data engineers and data scientists need to be able to manage the data for the following tasks:

- **Retrieve data** - Efficiently search and retrieve data based on timestamps, labels. This is important for building analytics and AI models.
- **Data Labeling** - Label data based on source, type, or timestamps, enabling efficient search and conditional data retrieval.
- **Data Access Control** - Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles and privileges.

With ReductStore, you can manage data efficiently and securely, ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive data.
ReductStore provides a RESTful API and SDKs for multiple programming languages, enabling data engineers and data scientists to programmatically interact with the data store.

The factory storage can be the last level of the DAQ system, or it stream data to the cloud for further processing and analytics.

## Cloud Data Acquisition System

The factory storage can be further extended to a **cloud-based data acquisition system**, providing additional scalability, redundancy, and advanced analytics capabilities.
It allows data to be accessed from anywhere, enabling remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, and AI-driven insights.

1. Data ingestion from multiple factories
2. Fully managed data storage
3. Using cloud blob storage for long-term storage
4. Subscription-based data access for ETL

## Conclusion

ReductStore is useful on each level of the data acquistion. You can use it only on the edge device, or on the factory level, or on the cloud level. It provides a fast and reliable way to collect and store data from the shop floor.
