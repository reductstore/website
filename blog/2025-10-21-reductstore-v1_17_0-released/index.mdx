![ReductStore v1.17.0 Released](./img/release_v117.png)

We are pleased to announce the release of the latest minor version of [**ReductStore**](/), [**1.17.0**](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/releases/tag/v1.17.0). ReductStore is a high-performance storage and streaming solution designed for storing and managing large volumes of historical data.

To download the latest released version, please visit our [**Download Page**](/download).

## What's new in 1.17.0?

This release includes several new features and enhancements. First, there are shared links for simplified data access. Second, there is support for S3-compatible storage backends.

These new features enhance the usability and flexibility of ReductStore for various use cases in the cloud and on-premises environments and make it easier to share and access data stored in the database.

### Shared Links for Data Access

ReductStore now supports shared links, allowing users to generate temporary URLs for accessing specific data records without requiring authentication.
This feature is particularly useful for sharing data with external collaborators or integrating with third-party applications.

You can use the Web Console to generate shared links for specific records or datasets.
Use the Data Browser page to look at the data. Choose the records you want, and click the "Share record" icon on the action panel.
The link that is created can be set to expire to make sure that people can only access it for a certain amount of time.

Now, anyone with the shared link can access the data directly via HTTP without needing to log in to ReductStore.

### S3-Compatible Storage Backend

ReductStore now supports S3-compatible storage backends, enabling users to utilize object storage instead of a local file system for underlying storage.
This feature provides greater flexibility and scalability for storing large datasets in the cloud.

Previously, ReductStore only supported local disk storage, and users could mount S3 buckets as local disks using FUSE drivers.
Now, you can configure ReductStore to natively use S3-compatible storage backends. No additional software is required.

We developed this feature with performance and cost optimization in mind.
ReductStore uses local disk storage as a cache layer to optimize performance when using S3-compatible storage backends.
Combined with batching multiple records into a single data block, this approach optimizes storage, retrieval, and transitional costs for AWS S3 storage classes, such as S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier.

To run ReductStore with an S3-compatible storage backend, set the following environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 8383:8383 \
    -e RS_REMOTE_BACKEND_TYPE=s3 \
    -e RS_REMOTE_BUCKET=<YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME> \
    -e RS_REMOTE_REGION=<YOUR_S3_REGION> \
    -e RS_REMOTE_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID> \
    -e RS_REMOTE_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> \
    -e RS_REMOTE_CACHE_PATH=/data/cache \
    -e RS_LICENSE_PATH=<PATH_TO_YOUR_LICENSE_FILE> \
    -v ${PWD}/data:/data/cache \
    reduct/store:latest
```

This feature is available only in the On-Promise edition of ReductStore. Please see the **[Pricing page](/pricing)** for more details.

## What next?

We are continuing to work on new features to improve your experience with ReductStore.
In the upcoming releases, we plan to introduce:

### Multiple Entities in a Single Request

Currently, you always need to specify a single entity in the request to write or query data.
This can be inconvenient when working with multiple entities or a dynamic list of entities.
In the next release, we plan to add support for writing to and querying multiple entities in a single request.

### Read Only Mode for ReductStore

Like many other databases, ReductStore requires exclusive access to the data directory while running.
This makes it impossible to run multiple instances of ReductStore on the same dataset for load balancing or high availability, for example.

One solution to this problem is to introduce a read-only mode for ReductStore. This allows one writer instance and multiple reader instances to access the same dataset concurrently.
This model enables scaling of read operations and improves availability without the need for complex clustering or replication mechanisms.

I hope you find those new features useful. If you have any questions or feedback, donâ€™t hesitate to use the [**ReductStore Community**](https://community.reduct.store/signup) forum.

Thanks for using [**ReductStore**](/)!
