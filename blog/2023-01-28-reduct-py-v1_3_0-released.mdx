We are happy to announce the release of [**version 1.3.0**](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-py/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
of the ReductStore SDK for Python! This release introduces several new features to support users in organizing and filtering their data.

One of the most notable new features is the ability to attach labels to data when writing and querying. Labels are
key-value pairs that can be used to classify and categorize data.
For example, you might use labels to store metadata about a record, such as its md5 sum or class.
To start using labels, you need the version of
the ReductStore database higher than [**1.3.0**](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#130---2023-01-26).

Here's an example of how to use labels when writing data:

```python
from reduct import Client

client = Client("https://play.reduct.store", api_token="reduct")
bucket = await client.create_bucket("my_data", exist_ok=True)
await bucket.write(
    "entry-1", b"something", labels={"label1": 123, "label2": 0.1, "label3": "hey"}
)
```

In this example, we're attaching the labels `{"label1": 123, "label2": 0.1, "label3": "hey"}` to the data.

When reading data, you can access the labels that were attached to it:

```python
# Read the data back, if no timestamp is specified, the latest record is returned
async with bucket.read("entry-1") as record:
    assert record.labels == {"label1": "123", "label2": "0.1", "label3": "hey"}

    data = await record.read_all()
    assert data == b"something"
```

Another new feature in this release is the ability to query data based on labels.
The query method now accepts two new parameters, include and exclude, which allow you to filter the results of a query
based on the labels attached to the data.

For example, you can use the include parameter to query for records that have specific labels:

```python
async for record in bucket.query(
        "entry-1", include={"label1": "value1", "label2": "value2"}
):
    # Do something with the record
    pass
```

This query returns all records with `label1` equals `value1` and `label2` equals to `value2`, and ignores all other
labels.

On the other hand, you can use the exclude parameter to query for records that do not have specific labels:

```python
async for record in bucket.query(
        "entry-1", exclude={"label1": "value1", "label2": "value2"}
):
    # Do something with the record
    pass
```

This query returns all records that not have `label1` equals `value1` and `label2` equals to `value2`.

Additionally, You can also pass `Content-Type` header for read and write operations, this header will be added to all
the requests that read and write data.

```python
await bucket.write(
    "entry-1", b"{'some': 'json'}", content_type="application/json"
)

async with bucket.read("entry-1") as record:
    assert record.content_type == "application/json"
```

With these new features, you can more easily organize and filter your data, making it easier to find the information you
need. We encourage you to upgrade to this latest version of the SDK and start taking advantage of these new
capabilities:

```
pip install reduct-py==1.3.0
```

We hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in this release, and as always, we welcome your feedback and
suggestions for future updates. Don't hesitate to reach out in [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/8wPtPGJYsn)
