Hello everyone,

We're excited to announce the release
of **version 0.4.0 of the Reduct CLI**!
This release includes a new `rcli export folder` command that allows you to export data from a bucket in your storage
engine to a local folder on your computer.
This can be useful if you want to make a copy of your data for backup or offline access. For more information, 
see the [**documentation**](https://cli.reduct.store/en/latest/docs/export/).

To update to the latest version of the Reduct CLI, use the following command:

```
pip install -U reduct-cli
```

In addition to the new rcli export folder command, we've also made some improvements to the documentation and updated it
after rebranding.

if you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to use the [**ReductStore Community**](https://community.reduct.store) forum.

Thanks for using ReductStore!
