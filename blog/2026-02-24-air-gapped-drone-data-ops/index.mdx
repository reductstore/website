# Air-Gapped Drone Data Operations with Delayed Sync and Auditability

Air-gapped drone programs need a storage design that works when the network does not. Most failures happen in the same places: inconsistent local retention, manual copy workflows, and no reliable proof of what was captured, replicated, or skipped.

This guide is a **ReductStore-first blueprint** for operating drone pipelines in disconnected environments with delayed synchronization and an auditable data trail.

## Who this is for

- Defense and aerospace teams running disconnected UAV missions
- Integrators building edge-to-ground-station data pipelines
- Teams replacing ad-hoc file drops or fragile rsync scripts

## The operational constraints (problem framing)

In air-gapped operations, your storage layer must support all of this simultaneously:

1. **Offline-first ingestion** on edge compute
2. **Deterministic retention** under finite disk constraints
3. **Selective sync** (only policy-approved records move out)
4. **Auditability** for chain-of-custody and compliance reviews
5. **Simple recovery** after power/network interruptions

:::warning
If your workflow depends on “upload after mission if someone remembers,” you don’t have a reliable pipeline.

## Reference architecture (ReductStore)

### Edge node (on drone or companion computer)

- Run ReductStore locally (single binary / container)
- Store sensor artifacts as timestamped records:
  - images/video chunks
  - telemetry batches
  - logs/events
  - model outputs
- Attach labels for downstream policy routing (`mission_id`, `sensor`, `classification`, `priority`)

### Delayed sync boundary

- Keep the drone fully operational while disconnected
- Queue replication tasks and execute only when approved links are available
- Filter what is replicated by label policy (not just by path)

### Ground/secure zone

- Receive replicated records into controlled ReductStore buckets
- Preserve metadata/labels for traceability
- Query by time windows and labels for mission review and incident analysis

## Data model (initial schema draft)

Use a consistent label contract from day one:

```text
mission_id=<uuid>
platform_id=<drone-id>
sensor=<camera|imu|lidar|event>
classification=<public|restricted|secret>
replication_policy=<none|delayed|approved>
checksum=<sha256>
```

This enables deterministic filtering and repeatable audits.

## Retention strategy (offline safety)

- Configure bucket quotas per sensor class
- Use FIFO by volume for high-rate streams
- Reserve “protected” buckets for critical mission events
- Keep retention policy explicit and versioned in infra config

## Replication policy (delayed + selective)

Recommended baseline:

- Replicate only `replication_policy=approved`
- Prioritize low-bandwidth metadata before large media payloads
- Include labels needed for compliance review
- Log replication outcomes per mission window

:::info
ReductStore replication and label-based querying are the core primitives that make this architecture practical without custom ingestion services.

## Auditability model

Track and verify at three levels:

1. **Capture audit:** record written with timestamp + labels + checksum
2. **Replication audit:** when/where each approved record was copied
3. **Access audit:** who queried/exported mission data and when

## Implementation plan (for publication draft)

- [ ] Add deployment example (Docker/Snap) for edge node
- [ ] Add concrete ReductStore replication config block
- [ ] Add SDK snippet (Python) for labeled writes + checksum label
- [ ] Add query snippet for post-mission audit report generation
- [ ] Add internal links to related ReductStore posts/docs

## Internal links to add in final draft

- `/blog/store-robotic-data`
- `/blog/store-ros-topics`
- `/blog/distributed-storage-mobile-robotics`
- `/docs/guides/data-replication`
- `/docs/guides/query-data`

## Positioning summary (editorial)

The key message of this article is not generic “edge storage is hard.”
It is:

> **ReductStore provides the minimum reliable primitives (timestamped blob records, labels, retention control, and selective replication) to make air-gapped drone data operations repeatable and auditable.**
