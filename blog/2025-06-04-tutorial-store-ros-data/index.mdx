![ROS 2 Data Storage Tutorial](./img/tutorial-store-ros-data.png)

In this tutorial, we will create a custom ROS 2 Humble package called **`rosbag2reduct`** that records incoming ROS 2 topics into MCAP bag files on a Raspberry Pi and automatically uploads those files to a ReductStore instance with metadata labels. We'll walk through setting up ROS 2 Humble on the Pi, interfacing a USB camera using the `v4l2_camera` driver, deploying a lightweight YOLOv5 (nano) object detection node (using ONNX Runtime) to produce detection metadata, and implementing the `rosbag2reduct` node to capture data and offload it. We will also cover installing ReductStore on the Pi, configuring replication of labeled data to a central storage on your laptop (using label-based filters via the web console). This end-to-end guide is structured with clear steps, code examples, and configuration snippets to help you build and deploy the system.

## Prerequisites and Architecture

Before beginning, ensure you have the following:

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, a USB camera, and an internet connection.
- **OS:** Ubuntu or Desktop Server (22.04 LTS or later) on the Raspberry Pi.
- **Laptop/PC:** A separate machine on the same network, to serve as a central data store.

In this tutorial, we will set up the following architecture:

![Tutorial Architecture](./img/tutorial_architecture.tiny.png)

<small style={{ display: "block", marginTop: "-20px" }}>
  Architecture: Raspberry Pi with ROS 2, USB camera, YOLOv5n, and ReductStore;
  Laptop with ReductStore Web Console.
</small>

- **Raspberry Pi:** Running ROS 2 Humble, interfacing with a USB camera, and running a YOLOv5n object detection node with ONNX Runtime.
- **Laptop/PC:** Running a ReductStore instance (acting as a central data store) and ReductStore's Web Console for managing data.
- **Network:** The Pi and the laptop are on the same network. The Pi will upload data to the ReductStore instance on the laptop automatically.

### 1. Install Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi

If not already done, flash Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi on a microSD card and boot your Pi. You can [**download Ubuntu images for Raspberry Pi from the official site**](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi). Ensure you have internet access and update the system:

```bash
# On Raspberry Pi
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Install ROS 2 Humble on Raspberry Pi

Follow the steps below to set up **ROS 2** on your Raspberry Pi. This guide assumes you are using a supported 64-bit Ubuntu OS (e.g., 22.04, 24.04). ROS 2 is available in multiple distributions such as **Jazzy**, **Humble**, and **Noetic**. If you're unsure, we recommend using the latest **LTS version**, which we can install via the commands below.

1. **Setup Locale:**

   ```bash
   sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
   sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   ```

2. **Add ROS 2 apt Repository:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install software-properties-common
   sudo add-apt-repository universe
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
   sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. **Install ROS 2 Packages:** For a baseline, install ROS 2 base packages (or `ros-<distro>-desktop` if you need GUI tools):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-base -y
   ```

   This will install core ROS 2 packages including `rosbag2`. You may verify the installation by sourcing the setup script:

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
   ros2 -h    # Should show ROS 2 commands
   ```

4. **Install Build Tools:** We will create custom packages, so install development tools:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions python3-rosdep -y
   sudo rosdep init
   rosdep update
   ```

### 3. Create a ROS 2 Workspace

Set up a workspace for our project (if you don't have one):

```bash
# On Raspberry Pi
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build  # just to initialize, will be empty initially
```

Add `source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash` to your `~/.bashrc` so that the workspace is sourced on each new shell, or remember to source it in each terminal when using the workspace. We will add packages to this workspace in subsequent steps.

## Setting up the USB Camera with `v4l2_camera`

We'll use the `v4l2_camera` ROS 2 package to interface with the USB camera via Video4Linux2. This package publishes images from any V4L2-compatible camera (most USB webcams) as ROS 2 image topics.

### 1. Install the `v4l2_camera` Package

On the Raspberry Pi, install the driver node via apt:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-v4l2-camera -y
```

This installs the `v4l2_camera` node and its dependencies. Alternatively, you could build it from source, but the binary is available for Humble.

### 2. Connect and Verify the Camera

Plug in the USB camera to the Pi. Verify that it's recognized by listing video devices:

```bash
ls /dev/video*
# You should see /dev/video0 (and possibly /dev/video1, etc. if multiple video capture interfaces are connected)
```

If `/dev/video0` is present, the system sees the camera (at list one). You might also install `v4l2-utils` and run `v4l2-ctl --list-devices` to see the camera name and capabilities. You can also run `v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext` to see supported resolutions and formats.

### 3. Run the Camera Node

Launch the camera driver to start publishing images:

```bash
# In a sourced ROS 2 environment on the Pi
ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node
```

By default, this node will open `/dev/video0` and start publishing images to the `~/image_raw` topic (type `sensor_msgs/Image`) at a default resolution of 640x480 and pixel format YUYV converted to `rgb8` (see [**ROS 2 camera driver for Video4Linux2 Documentation**](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/p/v4l2_camera/)). You should see console output from the node indicating it opened the device and is streaming.

Open a new terminal (with ROS sourced) on the Pi (or from a laptop connected to the ROS 2 network) and verify images are coming through, e.g., by running `rqt_image_view`:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rqt-image-view -y  # if not installed
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```

In `rqt_image_view`, select `/image_raw` to view the camera feed. This confirms the camera setup is working.

**Note:** You can adjust parameters by remapping or via ROS 2 parameters, e.g., to change resolution or device:

```bash
ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node --ros-args -p image_size:="[1280,720]" -p video_device:="/dev/video0"
```

This would set the camera to 1280x720 resolution (if supported).

## Deploying a Lightweight YOLOv5 Object Detection Node

Next, we set up an object detection node to analyze the camera images and output metadata (`object_detected` and `confidence_score`). We'll use **YOLOv5n (Nano)** - the smallest YOLOv5 model ("only" 1.9 million parameters) which is ideal for resource-constrained devices ([**see releases at ultralytics/yolov5**](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases)). We will run inference using the ONNX Runtime, which allows running the model without needing the full PyTorch framework on the Pi.

### 1. Install ONNX Runtime and Dependencies

On the Raspberry Pi, install the ONNX Runtime Python package and OpenCV (for image processing):

```bash
pip install onnxruntime opencv-python
```

_(If `pip` isn't available, use `sudo apt install python3-pip` to install it. You may also install `numpy` if not already present, as ONNX Runtime will likely need it.)_

### 2. YOLOv5n ONNX Model

We need the YOLOv5n model in ONNX format. To do that, we can clone the YOLOv5 repository on a more powerful machine than the Pi and export the model:

```bash
# On a PC or via Colab:
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt  # includes PyTorch
python export.py --weights yolov5n.pt --include onnx
```

This will create `yolov5n.onnx`. Transfer that file to your Raspberry Pi (e.g., via SCP).

For this tutorial, assume `yolov5n.onnx` is now on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., placed in `~/ros2_ws/src`).

### 3. Create a ROS 2 Package for the YOLO Node (optional)

You can integrate the YOLO inference in the same package as `rosbag2reduct`, but for modularity, let's create a separate ROS 2 Python package called `yolo_detector`.

In the workspace src directory, run:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python yolo_detector --dependencies rclpy sensor_msgs std_msgs
```

This will create a `yolo_detector` folder with a Python package structure. Edit `yolo_detector/package.xml` to add dependencies for `opencv-python` and `onnxruntime` (since these are non-ROS dependencies, we list them for documentation; you might use `pip` in the installation step rather than rosdep). For example, inside `<exec_depend>` tags, add:

```xml
<exec_depend>onnxruntime</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>opencv-python</exec_depend>
```

### 4. Implement the YOLO Detection Node

Create a file `yolo_detector/yolo_detector/yolo_node.py` with the following content:

<details>

<summary>**YoloDetectorNode (Python code)**</summary>

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
from std_msgs.msg import String, Float32
import cv2
import numpy as np
import onnxruntime as ort

class YoloDetectorNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('yolo_detector')
        # Load the YOLOv5n ONNX model
        model_path = '/path/to/yolov5n.onnx'  # TODO: update to actual path
        self.session = ort.InferenceSession(model_path, providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
        self.get_logger().info(f"Loaded model {model_path}")

        # Get model input details for preprocessing
        model_inputs = self.session.get_inputs()
        self.input_name = model_inputs[0].name
        self.input_shape = model_inputs[0].shape  # e.g., [1, 3, 640, 640]
        self.img_height = self.input_shape[2]
        self.img_width = self.input_shape[3]

        # Subscribers and publishers
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(Image, '/image_raw', self.image_callback, 10)
        self.pub_object = self.create_publisher(String, 'object_detected', 10)
        self.pub_conf = self.create_publisher(Float32, 'confidence_score', 10)

        # If the model requires normalization factors or specific transformations, define them:
        self.mean = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])  # YOLOv5 models assume 0-255 input, no mean subtraction
        self.std = np.array([255.0, 255.0, 255.0])  # we'll scale 0-1 later by dividing by 255

    def image_callback(self, msg: Image):
        # Convert ROS Image message to OpenCV format (BGR array)
        # Assuming msg.encoding is 'rgb8' as provided by v4l2_camera default output
        img = np.frombuffer(msg.data, dtype=np.uint8).reshape(msg.height, msg.width, -1)
        # Convert RGB to BGR as YOLO model might expect BGR input (depending on training)
        img_bgr = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)

        # Resize and pad image to model input shape (letterboxing if needed)
        input_img = cv2.resize(img_bgr, (self.img_width, self.img_height))
        # Convert to float32 and normalize 0-1
        input_img = input_img.astype('float32') / 255.0
        # transpose to [channels, height, width]
        input_blob = np.transpose(input_img, (2, 0, 1))
        input_blob = np.expand_dims(input_blob, axis=0)  # shape [1,3,H,W]

        # Run inference
        outputs = self.session.run(None, {self.input_name: input_blob})

        # Parse outputs to find the highest confidence detection (for simplicity)
        # YOLOv5 ONNX output typically includes [1, num_boxes, 85] array (for COCO: 4 box coords, 1 objness, 80 class scores)
        detections = outputs[0]
        # Filter by confidence threshold (e.g., 0.5)
        conf_threshold = 0.5
        best_label = "none"
        best_conf = 0.0
        if detections is not None:
            for det in detections[0]:
                obj_conf = det[4]
                class_conf = det[5:]  # class confidences
                score = obj_conf * np.max(class_conf)
                class_id = np.argmax(class_conf)
                if score > conf_threshold and score > best_conf:
                    best_conf = float(score)
                    best_label = str(class_id)  # or use a class id->name mapping

        # Publish results
        self.pub_object.publish(String(data=best_label))
        self.pub_conf.publish(Float32(data=best_conf))
        self.get_logger().info(f"Detected: {best_label} ({best_conf:.2f})")

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = YoloDetectorNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()
```

</details>

**Explanation:** This node subscribes to the camera images (`/image_raw`), processes each frame through the YOLOv5n model, and publishes two topics:

- `object_detected` (std_msgs/String): the class label (or ID) of the primary detected object (or `"none"` if none above threshold).
- `confidence_score` (std_msgs/Float32): the confidence score of that detection.

For simplicity, we took the detection with highest confidence above a threshold. In a real scenario, you probably output multiple detections or more info (bounding boxes, etc.), but we only need metadata for this tutorial.

Make sure to adjust the `model_path` to the actual location of your `yolov5n.onnx`. Also note that without class name mapping, `best_label` is currently the class index (as string). You can map this index to an actual label (e.g., using the COCO class list below).

Also, update `setup.py` entry points to include our node script:

```python
setup(
    ...
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'yolo_node = yolo_detector.yolo_node:main',
        ],
    },
)
```

### 5. Build and Run the YOLO Node

Add `onnxruntime` and `opencv-python` to your workspace's requirements (you might include them in a `requirements.txt` for the package and use `pip` to install, since they are pip packages). For now, ensure they are installed via pip as done earlier.

Build the workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select yolo_detector
source install/local_setup.bash
```

Run the YOLO detection node in a new terminal on the Pi:

```bash
ros2 run yolo_detector yolo_node.py
```

You should see log output from the node whenever it processes an image (every frame or at least when something is detected, depending on your logging). The node will publish messages on `object_detected` and `confidence_score` topics.

You can echo these topics in another terminal to verify:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /object_detected
ros2 topic echo /confidence_score
```

For example, if a person is detected with 85% confidence. You should see messages like:

```yaml
object: "0"
confidence: 0.85
```

Now we have a camera streaming images and a detector outputting metadata. Next, we'll create the `rosbag2reduct` package to record these data and handle file rotation and uploading to ReductStore.

## Recording and Uploading Data with `ros2_reduct_agent`

`ros2_reduct_agent` is a ROS 2 node that records selected topics, splits them into MCAP segments, compresses the data, and uploads each segment to ReductStore. It is configured through a single YAML file and requires no custom code.

### 1. Clone, install dependencies, and build

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/reductstore/ros2-reduct-agent.git
cd ..

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select ros2_reduct_agent
source install/local_setup.bash
```

### 2. Create `config.yaml`

This configuration defines how `ros2_reduct_agent` records topics and uploads them to ReductStore.

- `url`: ReductStore endpoint.
- `api_token`: Access token (can be empty if anonymous access is allowed).
- `bucket`: Target bucket in ReductStore.
- `include_topics`: List of ROS 2 topics to record.
- `split.max_duration_s`: Maximum duration of each MCAP file in seconds.
- `chunk_size_bytes`: Size of MCAP chunks.
- `compression`: Compression algorithm (`none`, `lz4`, or `zstd`).
- `filename_mode`: Naming mode for output files.

```yaml
/**/*:
  ros__parameters:
    storage:
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8383"
      api_token: "ACCESS_TOKEN"
      bucket: "pi_robot"
    pipelines:
      camera_stream:
        include_topics:
          - /image_raw
          - /object_detected
          - /confidence_score
          - /rosout
        split:
          max_duration_s: 60
        chunk_size_bytes: 1048576
        compression: "zstd"
        filename_mode: "timestamp"
```

### 3. Run the agent

Make sure the ReductStore instance is running locally on port 8383, then run:

```bash
ros2 run ros2_reduct_agent recorder \
  --ros-args --params-file ~/ros2_ws/config.yaml
```

Every 60 seconds, the agent creates a new MCAP file, uploads it to the `pi_robot` bucket in ReductStore, and deletes the local copy after a successful upload.

## Installing and Configuring ReductStore on the Raspberry Pi

Before running the `rosbag2reduct` node, we need a ReductStore server running on the Pi to accept uploads. ReductStore is a lightweight time-series object storage, perfect for edge devices. We will install it on the Pi and create a bucket for our bag files.

### 1. Install ReductStore on Raspberry Pi

The easiest way on Ubuntu is to use **snap** or **Docker**. We'll use snap for simplicity:

```bash
# On Raspberry Pi
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd -y   # if snapd is not already installed
sudo snap install reductstore
```

This will install ReductStore from the Snap Store. The snap should set up ReductStore as a service listening on port 8383 by default. (If using a different OS or if snap isn't desired, you can use Docker: e.g., `docker run -d -p 8383:8383 -v ~/reduct_data:/data reduct/store:latest` to run ReductStore in a container.)

> **Note:** The database will listen on `http://0.0.0.0:8383` (accessible to the LAN). Ensure this port is allowed through any firewall if you want external access.

Check that ReductStore is running:

```bash
sudo snap services reductstore  # should show active
curl http://127.0.0.1:8383/api/v1/info
```

The `curl` command should return JSON info about the instance (like version, uptime, etc.).

### 2. (Optional) Configure ReductStore

By default, ReductStore doesn't require authentication for local use (anonymous access is allowed). This is fine for our edge scenario on a local network. If you want to set up access tokens or adjust storage quotas, you can do so by following the [**Access Control documentation**](/docs/guides/access-control). For now, we'll use defaults.

We will use the **Web Console** to verify data and to set up replication later. The web console is accessible from a browser at the server's address (it's the same as the API endpoint). For example, on the Pi, open `http://<raspberrypi_ip>:8383` in a browser - you should see the ReductStore Web Console interface (a simple GUI).

### 3. Create a Bucket for ROS bag data

Our `rosbag2reduct` code will attempt to create a bucket named `"pi_robot"`. We called `create_bucket("pi_robot", exist_ok=True)` in the code, so the bucket will be created on first run if it doesn't exist. You can also create it manually via the web console:

- Navigate to **Buckets** and create a new bucket named “pi_robot”. (You can set a quota, e.g., a FIFO quota to avoid filling up the disk on the Pi.)

<small style={{ display: "block", marginTop: "-20px" }}>
  ReductStore Web Console: Creating a bucket named "pi_robot" for storing ROS
  bags.
</small>

Now, ReductStore is set up on the Pi and ready to accept data. We can run the complete system to record ROS data, detect objects, and upload to ReductStore.

## Running the Complete System

We have three ROS 2 nodes to run on the Raspberry Pi:

- The camera driver (`v4l2_camera_node`)
- The YOLO detection node (`YoloDetectorNode`)
- The rosbag2reduct recorder/uploader node (`Rosbag2ReductNode`)

It's best to run each in its own terminal (or use a launch file to launch them together). For clarity, we'll do it step-by-step:

**Terminal 1:** Camera node

```bash
# Terminal 1 on Pi (source ROS 2 and workspace)
ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node
```

**Terminal 2:** YOLO detection node

```bash
# Terminal 2 on Pi (source ROS 2 and workspace)
ros2 run yolo_detector yolo_node.py
```

(If you set up the entry point, you could do `ros2 run yolo_detector yolo_detector` or similar, but here we assume running the script directly.)

**Terminal 3:** rosbag2reduct recorder node

```bash
# Terminal 3 on Pi (source ROS 2 and workspace)
ros2 run rosbag2reduct rosbag2reduct
```

(This uses the console script entry point we defined. Alternatively `ros2 run rosbag2reduct recorder_node.py` if not configured as an entry point.)

Now monitor the outputs:

- The camera node should just stream (no text output unless error or warning).
- The YOLO node will log detections (as we coded with `get_logger().info` on each detection).
- The rosbag2reduct node will log bag rotations and uploads. For example, you should see logs like “Opened new bag: rosbag*20230325_101500_0” and later “Uploading bag 0 with metadata: object=person, confidence=0.85” then “Uploaded rosbag*... to ReductStore with labels ...” etc.

Let this run for a while. By default, every 60 seconds it will finalize a bag and upload it. If you want to trigger a rotation sooner (for testing), you could reduce `bag_duration` or even manually call the rotation function (not easily via ROS, unless you expose a service but it's not implemented here).

### 1. Verify Data in ReductStore

On the Pi (or from any machine that can access the Pi's port 8383), open the ReductStore Web Console in a browser: **`http://<raspberrypi_ip>:8383`**. You should see the bucket “pi_robot”. Click it to see the list of entries.

Each uploaded bag file appears as a **record** in the `rosbags` entry of the `pi_robot` bucket. The record name is the bag file name, and you should be able to see its labels, e.g., `object: 1` and `confidence: 0.85` attached to that record.. You can also see the timestamp of each record (when it was uploaded).

You have successfully set up the edge device to capture ROS data and push it to ReductStore with metadata labels!

## Setting up Replication to a Central ReductStore (Laptop)

With data being collected on the Pi, we likely want to aggregate it on a central server (e.g., your laptop or a cloud instance) for analysis or long-term storage.

ReductStore's replication feature allows the Pi (source) to **push** new records to another ReductStore instance (destination) in real-time, filtering by labels so that, for example, only important events (e.g., specific objects or high-confidence detections) are sent for long-term storage.

:::info
Replication lets you stream only the data you need from the edge to the cloud or between edge devices. You can filter by label and push data without constant polling. If the device is offline or the destination is down, the data waits and replicates later.
:::

In this section, we'll:

- Run ReductStore on the laptop.
- Use the ReductStore Web Console to create a replication task on the Pi's instance that filters and forwards data to the laptop's instance based on labels.
- Verify that replication works.

### 1. Install/Run ReductStore on Laptop

On your laptop (assuming Ubuntu 22.04 or any system with Docker or Snap):

- **Option A: Docker** - run ReductStore in a container:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8383:8383 -v ~/reduct_data:/data reduct/store:latest
  ```

  This runs ReductStore locally on port 8383 and stores data in `~/reduct_data` on your laptop.

- **Option B: Native** - you could similarly install via Snap (`sudo snap install reductstore`) or use a binary. Docker is quick and easy.

After starting it, ensure you can access it:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8383/api/v1/info
```

should return info as before (but for the laptop's instance).

Open the web console on the laptop: `http://localhost:8383` and keep it open for monitoring.

> Create a bucket named “pi_robot” on the laptop as well, otherwise the replication task will fail (it needs the destination bucket to exist).

:::tip
Use provisioning to automate bucket creation and other setup steps in a real deployment. See [**Configuration/Provisioning Documentation**](/docs/configuration#provisioning) for more.
:::

**Networking:** Make sure your laptop is accessible from the Pi. If both are on the same LAN, you might use the laptop's IP (e.g., 192.168.x.x). If the laptop's ReductStore is in Docker, ensure the port 8383 is open (it is published in the run command above). For testing, you might temporarily disable firewall or ensure port 8383 is allowed.

Find your laptop's IP address (e.g., `hostname -I` on Linux) - let's say it's `192.168.1.100` for example.

### 2. Configure Replication on the Pi via Web Console

On the Pi's web console (**`http://<raspberrypi_ip>:8383`**), look for “Replications” and the “+” to add replication). We want to create a replication task that sends data to the laptop.

Fill in the replication settings as:

- **Source Bucket:** pi_robot (on Pi)
- **Destination URL:** `http://<laptop_ip>:8383` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8383`)
- **Destination Bucket:** pi_robot (on laptop)
- **Replication Name:** (give it a name like “to_laptop”)
- **Entries:** `rosbags` (or whatever entry name you used in `bucket.write()`), or leave blank to replicate all entries.
- **Filter Records**: add the "Exclude" filter rule for `object` equals `"none"`.

Start the replication task. The Pi's ReductStore will now start forwarding new records that meet the criteria to the laptop, in real-time. It's a push model from Pi to laptop, so the laptop doesn't need to know about the Pi or poll it - the Pi will push new records as they arrive.

### 3. Test Replication

Back on the Pi, ensure the `rosbag2reduct` node is still running and creating new records. When the next bag file is uploaded on the Pi, if it meets the replication filter conditions, the Pi's ReductStore replication task will immediately send it to the laptop.

On the **laptop's web console**, open the “pi_robot” bucket. You should start seeing records appear that correspond to those on the Pi (with a slight delay for transfer). The labels should also be present. If you configured a filter (e.g., confidence > 0.8), try to produce a detection above that confidence on the Pi (point the camera at an easily recognized object or adjust threshold on the Pi code for testing).

Records not meeting the condition will stay only on the Pi and eventually be overwritten if Pi's FIFO quota is set.

You can also check the replication status on the Pi's web console; it may show last replicated record timestamp etc., indicating it's working.

At this point, we have a robust pipeline:

- Raspberry Pi captures camera data and detection metadata.
- `rosbag2reduct` segments the data into time-based bags, labels them, and pushes to local storage.
- ReductStore on Pi retains recent data and automatically forwards critical data to the laptop's ReductStore based on labels.
- The laptop accumulates the forwarded data in its own ReductStore bucket, which you can browse or integrate with other systems.

## Best Practices and Further Improvements

This tutorial only scratches the surface of building a robust data acquisition and storage pipeline for robotics. Here are some best practices and further improvements to consider:

### 📊 Separate Storage Topics by Types

Separate storage streams for different topic categories (e.g., telemetry vs. raw sensor data) to optimise storage and retrieval. This allows you to apply different retention policies, access controls, or replication rules to each category.

- 📖 See [**3 Ways to Store ROS Topics**](/blog/store-ros-topics)
- 📘 Example: [**How to Store Images in ROS 2**](/blog/tutorials/ros/optimal-image-storage-solutions-for-ros-based-computer-vision)

Here are some common data categories and their characteristics to consider:

| Category                    | Examples                                        | Characteristics                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lightweight telemetry**   | GPS, IMU, joint states, system status           | Low bandwidth, near real-time, useful for business analytics           |
| **Downsampled sensor data** | Lower framerate/resolution camera or lidar data | Mid-size, great for monitoring and incident triage                     |
| **Full-resolution data**    | Raw camera frames, high-fps lidar, depth maps   | High volume (up to 1TB/hour), needed for debugging or model retraining |

### 🗜️ Compress High-Bandwidth Topics

We can se ROS 2's built-in compression mechanisms for image topics and large messages to reduce bandwidth and storage costs.

- 🖼️ Example: Use `/image_raw/compressed` instead of raw image streams

### 🔐 Use Token-Based Authentication

This is especially relevant for cloud storage or remote ReductStore instances. Use access tokens to secure data transfers and prevent unauthorized access.

### ⚙️ Use Non-Blocking Operations

When uploading large files or performing storage operations, use non-blocking (asynchronous) methods to avoid freezing your ROS 2 nodes. This keeps your system responsive and prevents dropped messages or missed frames.

### 📉 Combine Downsampling with Replication

This is typical in ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) pipelines. The idea is to save everything locally (on the robot) at high resolution and framerate, then stream part of the data to the cloud or a central server at a lower resolution or lower frequency.

- ➡️ Example: Store 1 FPS video in cloud, keep 30 FPS original on robot SSD
- 🔄 See example in: [**Building a Data Acquisition System for Manufacturing**](/blog/daq-manufacture-system)

### ❄️ Offload Data to Cold Storage

For long-term archiving, consider offloading data to cold storage to reduce costs while keeping data accessible.

- ⚖️ Example: Keep 30 days of data locally, archive older data to Google Cloud Storage.
- 📖 Guide: [**Deploy on ReductStore Cloud**](/docs/guides/cloud/saas)

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we set up a complete pipeline on a Raspberry Pi running ROS 2 Humble that captures camera data and AI output, records it to MCAP bag files with a custom Python node, and automatically offloads those files to a time-series object store. We added labels to each record (object ID detected and YOLO's confidence level). We configured replication to forward labeled data to a central instance on a laptop, filtering by labels to reduce bandwidth - for example, forwarding only "interesting" events (excluding "none" detections).

The end-to-end system demonstrates how to build a robust data logging and centralized storage solution for robotics. Of course, this tutorial must be adapted to your specific use case and environment. Keep in mind that the pipeline is highly customizable and can be adapted to different scenarios (separating topics by type, using specific filters, adding more metadata, etc.).

We hope this end-to-end tutorial helps you build your own ROS 2 data acquisition system. Happy hacking!
