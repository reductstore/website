Hello, everyone!
We are excited to announce the release of
the [**Python client SDK v1.2.0**](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-py/releases/tag/v1.2.0)! This release includes
support for the
[**ReductStore HTTP API v1.2**](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and several other
improvements.

One of the new features in this release is the `Client.me()` method. This method allows you to get information about the
current token being used to authenticate with the ReductStore instance. It returns a `FullTokenInfo` object, which
contains
information about the token, including its name, creation time, and permissions.

To use the method, simply call it on a Client instance:

```python
from reduct import Client

client = Client('https://play.reduct.store', api_token='my-token')

# Get the current token info
token_info = await client.me()

# Print the token name and creation time
print(f"Token name: {token_info.name}")
print(f"Token created at: {token_info.created_at}")

# Print the token permissions
print(f"Full access: {token_info.permissions.full_access}")
print(f"Read access: {token_info.permissions.read}")
print(f"Write access: {token_info.permissions.write}")
```

In addition to the `Client.me` method, this release also includes improvements to the documentation and a migration to
using a
`pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies.

To upgrade to the latest version of the reduct-py SDK, run the following command:

```
pip install -U reduct-py
```
