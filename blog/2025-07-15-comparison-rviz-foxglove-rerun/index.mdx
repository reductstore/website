In robotics development, effective visualization and analysis tools are essential for monitoring, debugging, and interpreting complex sensor data. RViz, Foxglove, and Rerun are three widely used tools that serve this purpose, each with a distinct approach and feature set.

[**RViz (ROS Visualization)** is the classic 3D visualization tool built for the ROS ecosystem](https://wiki.ros.org/rviz). It's designed to help developers and engineers monitor and debug ROS-based robots in real time.

[**Foxglove** is a modern data visualization and inspection platform for robotics and physical AI systems](https://foxglove.dev/about), aiming to simplify how teams collect, visualize, analyze, and manage large volumes of diverse sensor data.

[**Rerun** is a lightweight, native desktop application focused on fast and efficient visualization of robotics data](https://rerun.io), enabling developers to quickly explore and debug both live and recorded sensor streams with minimal setup.

This article compares these tools across several practical criteria: pricing, cross-platform, remote work and multi-user support, user interface, extensibility, ROS integration, performance with large data, and visualization and analysis capabilities. The goal is to provide a clear overview of how each tool fits different development needs.

## **Pricing**

**RViz** and **RViz 2** are part of the ROS ecosystem and released under the BSD 3-Clause License. This permissive open-source license allows free use, modification, and redistribution (including commercial use), as long as the original copyright and license notices are preserved.

**Foxglove** offers a free tier that includes core features for up to 3 users, 10 devices, and 10 GB of cloud storage. For larger teams or needs (e.g., extra users, storage, private extensions, enterprise integrations), paid subscriptions are available, with pricing scaling by usage and support level. They also offer a free academic plan for qualified institutions, providing additional users and storage. Foxglove itself is proprietary software, though it is built on open protocols like MCAP and integrates with open-source ROS tooling.

**Rerun** is fully open-source under both the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses, with no current paid plans for the open-source core. The project follows an open-core model: the core visualizer and SDK are free, while a commercial platform is in early access for teams needing cloud-based storage, collaboration tools, advanced analytics, and scalable CI/CD workflows. This upcoming offering is positioned to complement the open-source foundation.

## **Platform & Collaboration**

**RViz** and **RViz 2** are primarily developed for Linux, where they deliver the most stable and reliable performance. RViz 2 extends support to Windows and macOS as part of ROS 2, but these versions remain less mature and less frequently used. They often require manual setup or compilation, though support is steadily improving with newer ROS 2 releases.

Both RViz versions are local desktop applications, not designed out-of-the-box for remote or multi-user scenarios. Workarounds like SSH with X11 forwarding, VNC, or running RViz locally while connecting remotely to a ROS system are possible but tend to be fragile, require manual configuration, and may suffer from performance or latency issues depending on network and hardware conditions. To mitigate these limitations, early tools like `ROS3D.js` offered browser-based ROS 1 visualization but are now largely unmaintained and incompatible with ROS 2. Modern web visualization is typically done with tools like Foxglove, Webviz, or custom WebSocket-based interfaces. Additionally, some cloud robotics platforms offer remote visualization for ROS, though these solutions usually require additional integration effort.

**Foxglove** supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, available both as a native desktop app and through a web browser. This flexibility lets users work locally or remotely without installing software. Its browser interface supports multi-user collaboration, allowing teams to share layouts and securely stream live data in real time from any device with a web connection.

**Rerun** is a lightweight native desktop application available on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It requires minimal setup, enabling developers to quickly visualize and debug live or recorded sensor data without needing a browser or complex configuration. While Rerun lacks built-in multi-user or collaborative features, remote workflows commonly rely on recording and sharing `.rrd` log files for offline inspection, which is often more practical than real-time access via remote desktop or SSH tunnels. Integration into development workflows, such as Python environments, typically requires installing Rerun’s SDKs and dependencies.

## **User Interface**

**RViz** and **RViz 2** offer a powerful but somewhat dated user interface that prioritizes functionality over modern design. The learning curve can be steep, especially for beginners, due to its complex layout and the need to manually configure displays, topics, coordinate frames, and tools. The interface is built around multiple panels and dialogs that require careful setup, lacking the visual polish and streamlined workflows found in newer visualization tools.

**Foxglove** sports a modern, intuitive UI with flexible dashboards and responsive controls. It’s designed to be accessible to users at all experience levels, making it easier to explore, analyze, and share robotics data. The interface relies heavily on graphical elements rather than commands or configuration files, which lowers the barrier for users unfamiliar with ROS or robotics visualization.

**Rerun** provides a clean, straightforward interface focused on efficient data visualization. It balances simplicity with core functionality, offering easy-to-navigate views without overwhelming users. The UI is designed for minimal setup and intuitive exploration of data streams and logs. While Rerun emphasizes ease of use, it currently offers fewer customization options compared to both RViz and Foxglove.

## **Extensibility**

**RViz** (both ROS 1 and ROS 2) supports extensibility through C++ plugins, allowing users to develop and integrate custom visualizations, tools, and panels. This plugin architecture makes RViz highly adaptable across robotics domains such as perception, navigation, and manipulation. Many ROS packages ship with their own RViz plugins by default. However, developing and using custom plugins requires close coupling with the specific ROS environment. Moreover, plugins built for RViz in ROS 1 do not work directly in RViz 2, they often need modification or a complete rewrite to be compatible.

**Foxglove** extends its flexibility through an Extensions SDK, which lets developers create React-based visualizations using TypeScript. Its extension ecosystem supports easy sharing via an online registry, with no need for recompilation. Foxglove also provides APIs and libraries in C++, Python, and Rust, primarily for interacting with the MCAP file format, which enable integration with data sources like ROS (both versions), WebSocket streams, and recorded sensor data. Foxglove’s ecosystem further supports integrations with popular robotics and simulation tools such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Velodyne LiDAR, and Jupyter Notebooks, either directly or via external bridges.

**Rerun** focuses on extensibility through SDKs and APIs, especially targeting Python and other programming environments. Unlike RViz and Foxglove, Rerun lacks plugin-based customization or drag-and-drop extensions. Instead, it prioritizes programmatic data embedding and visualization, making it well suited for users building custom workflows via scripting and code.

While Rerun offers strong Python support, its core is built with Rust and the egui GUI framework — technologies that may be less familiar to robotics developers accustomed to Python, C++, or JavaScript. This can introduce a learning curve and limit low-level customization unless users are comfortable with Rust.

Rerun does not provide a simple or dynamic plugin system or scripting layer comparable to RViz’s C++ plugins or Foxglove’s TypeScript extensions. This restricts rapid prototyping or the easy integration of third-party tools on the fly.

However, its APIs robustly support integration with diverse data sources, including ROS topics, sensor streams, and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This makes Rerun a flexible tool for logging, visualizing, and debugging complex data pipelines.

This design suits users who prefer programming-driven customization over GUI-based tweaks. By enabling direct control over data ingestion and visualization, Rerun empowers developers to create highly tailored and dynamic workflows that can evolve alongside project needs.

## **ROS Integration**

**RViz** is tightly integrated with ROS, supporting direct interaction with live ROS topics. Originally developed for ROS 1, it has been succeeded by **RViz 2** for ROS 2, and remains a core visualization tool in many robotics workflows. This deep integration, however, limits RViz’s usability outside the ROS ecosystem. Both RViz and RViz 2 depend on a fully functioning ROS environment and are not designed to operate independently or handle non-ROS data without conversion.

**Foxglove** connects to live ROS systems via `foxglove_bridge`, a WebSocket-based bridge specifically designed for this purpose. The bridge runs on the same network as the ROS system and streams real-time ROS messages to Foxglove over WebSocket. This architecture enables remote monitoring and interaction with ROS data without requiring a local ROS installation. Unlike RViz, Foxglove can be used without a full ROS setup.

Beyond live streaming, Foxglove also supports opening and analyzing ROS bag files locally. This makes it easy to review recorded data, visualize topics, and troubleshoot issues offline, without needing an active ROS system.

**Rerun** supports integration with both ROS 1 and ROS 2, enabling live visualization of topics and inspection of recorded data. For ROS 2, Rerun officially maintained basic example scripts, hosted on GitHub, that use Python (`rclpy`) or C++ to subscribe to ROS 2 topics and forward selected data to the Rerun viewer. This remains a user-defined bridge rather than a native-plugin integration. ROS 1 integration is possible using custom nodes written in either C++ or Python (`rospy`) though it typically requires more manual setup. Unlike tools such as Foxglove, which use standardized communication protocols like `foxglove_websocket` via `foxglove_bridge` (and optionally `rosbridge`), Rerun ingests data directly through user-defined code and does not rely on ROS-specific bridge protocols. While Rerun avoids protocol-based bridging, it still requires users to write custom nodes that translate ROS messages into its own API.

Rerun is particularly well-suited for visualizing time-synchronized multimodal data, including sensor readings, 3D geometry, camera images, transforms, and trajectories. However, it currently lacks built-in support for certain ROS-specific features such as interactive TF tree exploration, occupancy/grid map overlays, and full URDF-based robot model visualization. Community-maintained examples (e.g., the `urdf_loader`) provide partial support for URDF rendering, but they do not yet match the feature depth and interactivity of RViz.

Rerun cannot currently open ROS bag files directly (`.bag` for ROS 1 or `.db3` for ROS 2). Instead, users replay these files using standard ROS tools (e.g., `rosbag play`, `ros2 bag play`) and forward selected topics into Rerun using custom Python or C++ bridge nodes. This workflow offers flexibility and performance but does require additional configuration. Rerun uses its own `.rrd` log format, optimized for high-throughput, time-seekable streaming and storage, rather than consuming native ROS bag files directly.

## **Performance with Large Data**

**RViz** is not fully optimized for handling very large datasets, such as dense point clouds, high-frequency topics, or long message histories. When visualizing large volumes of data, users may encounter performance issues like low frame rates, rendering lag, and elevated CPU or GPU usage. These bottlenecks arise because RViz continuously renders incoming ROS messages and stores message history in memory, which can quickly overwhelm system resources.

**RViz 2** improves on this with better support for multithreading and more efficient message transport through DDS. These enhancements can boost performance and scalability in ROS 2 environments. However, RViz 2 still struggles with very dense or high-rate data streams, especially when rendering complex 3D data in real time, and these improvements do not fully solve the challenges of high-density visualization. Performance can often be improved by reducing message history length, filtering or downsampling data, and disabling non-essential displays.

**Foxglove** can underperform relative to RViz in high-data scenarios, particularly when using the web-based version. Because it runs in a web browser, it’s constrained by browser memory limits, single-threaded JavaScript execution, and restricted access to hardware acceleration. As a result, visualizing large point clouds or streaming high-frequency topics may lead to lag, dropped frames, or browser instability. These limitations are especially apparent when handling continuous 3D data or large bag files.

That said, performance in Foxglove can vary depending on the use case and browser environment. The desktop application, which bypasses some browser limitations, can offer improved responsiveness. However, since it is built on Electron, it still inherits significant overhead related to memory usage and resource management common to Electron-based apps, though these issues are generally less severe than in the web version. For lighter workloads, such as 2D plots or moderate-frequency telemetry, Foxglove often performs well and benefits from its accessible UI and cross-platform support.

**Rerun** is designed with high performance in mind for large-scale, multimodal data workflows. Its native desktop application, developed in Rust and utilizing the modern WGPU rendering backend, has direct access to system resources, allowing it to efficiently handle dense point clouds, extensive message histories, and high-frequency data streams. Behind the scenes, Rerun employs techniques such as memory-mapped I/O, zero-copy data handling, and intelligent batching to minimize latency and reduce processing overhead.

These architectural decisions position Rerun as a promising tool for demanding robotics applications, including real-time sensor fusion, machine learning debugging, and post-mortem log analysis. Performance can be further enhanced by filtering or downsampling data streams according to specific needs. While formal benchmarks directly comparing Rerun with RViz or Foxglove are currently limited, early community feedback combined with its technical design suggests that Rerun scales effectively with complex datasets. Active development is ongoing to broaden its capabilities for robotics visualization and analysis.

## **Analysis & Visualization**

### **RViz & RViz 2**

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Real-time Visualization & Bag File Support**: Both RViz and RViz 2 support real-time visualization by subscribing to live ROS topics. They can also display data from recorded bag files (`.bag` files in ROS 1 and `.db3` or `.mcap` files in ROS 2), when those files are replayed using tools like `rosbag play` or `ros2 bag play`.

- **Data Format Support**: RViz visualizes a wide range of robot state information, including URDF robot models, coordinate transforms (TF), and various sensor data such as LIDAR, IMU, depth, and RGB cameras. It also supports odometry, localization, occupancy grid maps (used in SLAM), navigation data (paths, goals, trajectories), and interactive markers for user interaction. RViz 2 supports these same data types with ROS 2 message compatibility.

- **Interactive Markers**: These 3D UI elements enable users to manipulate objects within the visualization: setting navigation goals, adjusting robot end-effector positions, or dragging points for motion planning. Using them requires writing supporting ROS nodes and configuring interaction logic.

- **Highly Configurable Interface**: Users can add, remove, and arrange panels, and customize display properties such as colors, shapes, and update rates for each data type. These configurations can be saved and reloaded using `.rviz` files, streamlining repetitive workflows like navigation debugging or SLAM visualization. Multiple camera control modes (Orbit, FPS, Top-down) allow flexible 3D scene navigation.

- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Developers can extend RViz by creating custom visualizations and tools through C++ plugins. RViz 2 supports plugins too, built on a more modern and modular architecture.

**Limitations**:

- **Limited Analysis**. RViz and RViz 2 primarily serve visualization purposes and lack built-in tools for detailed message inspection, conditional logging, or advanced playback controls like pause, step, or speed adjustment. These capabilities typically require external tools such as `rqt_bag`, ROS command-line utilities, or third-party RViz plugins (e.g., `rosbag_panel`). Additionally, RViz does not consistently warn about invalid data (e.g., NaNs or infinities), which can result in missing or misleading visuals. These tools are not designed for deep offline data analysis and are best used alongside more specialized logging or analysis solutions.

- **No Time-Series Analysis**: RViz and RViz 2 do not support time-series plotting or statistical analysis. For these tasks, dedicated tools like `rqt_plot`, `PlotJuggler` (with ROS 2 support), or external environments like Jupyter with Python are more appropriate.

- **No Conditional Filtering**: RViz and RViz 2 display all incoming data without the ability to filter messages based on content or fields. Filtering must be performed upstream, often by custom ROS nodes. Some plugins or panels offer limited filtering but are not general solutions.

- **No Topic Synchronization**: RViz and RViz 2 subscribe to each topic independently and display messages as they arrive. They do not synchronize data streams from different topics based on timestamps, which can cause misalignment or inconsistencies in time-sensitive visualizations (e.g., camera images, LIDAR scans, TF frames). Achieving synchronized visualization requires external tools like `message_filters` or custom nodes.

- **No Built-in Logging or Export**: RViz and RViz 2 cannot automatically export visualized data or record screencasts. Users are limited to manual screenshots for capturing visuals. External tools or custom plugins are needed for recording or exporting data.

- **Limited Multi-Robot Support**: While RViz can display data from multiple robots by leveraging namespaces, the interface is not designed for straightforward multi-robot workflows. RViz 2 introduces modest improvements but still lacks dedicated UI features for managing multiple robots simultaneously.

### **Foxglove**

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Multi-Modal 3D Visualization**: Foxglove provides comprehensive 3D visualization for a variety of robotics data, including URDF robot models, TF trees, sensor streams (LIDAR, point clouds, camera feeds), occupancy grids, and navigation elements such as paths, goals, and costmaps. Users can interact with the scene in real time: rotating the view, toggling layers, and focusing on specific frames or topics. Multi-camera views, tooltips, and overlays enhance spatial understanding. Synchronized multi-viewports and flexible camera modes (free, fixed, follow-frame, sensor-aligned) make it possible to examine several spatial data streams side by side. All streams are synchronized through a shared timeline for consistent context across modalities.

- **Topic Synchronization & Playback Timeline**: Foxglove offers a unified, timestamp-based timeline that synchronizes data from multiple topics. This ensures time-aligned playback of sensor streams like RGB images, depth, point clouds, IMU, and TFs, useful both in real time and with recorded data. The timeline includes playback controls such as pause, frame-by-frame stepping, variable speed, and bookmarks for quickly navigating to key events. This tight time synchronization is a major advantage over RViz, enabling clearer insights into system behavior.

- **Advanced Analysis & Time-Series Tools**. Foxglove offers a capable set of tools for offline analysis of recorded data. Users can inspect messages in detail, filter them by topic or namespace, and control playback through an integrated timeline with pause, step-by-step navigation, and adjustable speed. To view custom ROS 2 message types with full support, messages are best recorded in or converted to the MCAP format, although Foxglove can open other formats with some limitations.

  For analyzing numeric data over time, Foxglove provides flexible plotting tools broadly comparable to `rqt_plot` or `PlotJuggler`. Users can visualize numeric fields from any message type, overlay multiple signals, zoom in on specific time ranges, and interactively adjust what’s displayed.

  These tools make it easy to explore sensor outputs, control signals, and algorithm behavior. Interactive graphs support switching between message series dynamically.

- **Modular & Configurable Interface**: The Foxglove UI is fully modular, letting users add, remove, duplicate, and rearrange panels such as 3D views, image feeds, message viewers, plots, diagnostics, and consoles. Each panel is highly configurable, supporting settings for color, scale, transparency, update rate, and filtering. Users can save layouts as `JSON` files, enabling reproducible setups, role-based dashboards, and fast task switching (e.g., from SLAM debugging to perception analysis). These layouts can be shared across teams or versioned over time.

- **Custom Panels & Extensions**: Foxglove allows users to build custom panels using plugins, enabling specialized interfaces tailored to specific workflows. These panels are embedded directly into the Foxglove interface, keeping everything streamlined and centralized. This is particularly valuable for companies developing internal tools or dashboards for robotics development and testing.

  Extensions are packaged as `.foxe` files and can be shared via the Foxglove Extensions Registry, either privately within an organization or publicly. While layouts can be shared via URLs or layout IDs to replicate interface setups, this sharing doesn’t include the actual panel code. Users must have the required extensions installed for the full functionality to work properly.

- **Cloud & Collaboration**: Foxglove can be run locally or in the cloud. Its cloud features include shared dashboards, timeline comments, and real-time collaboration, enabling teams to jointly review logs or live data remotely. This makes it particularly useful for distributed development, remote testing, or asynchronous data reviews.

**Limitations**:

- **Limited Real-Time 3D Interactivity**: Foxglove does not natively support interactive 3D markers like RViz. Users cannot directly manipulate objects in the 3D scene (e.g., setting goals, editing poses, or dragging elements) without building custom extensions. This limits Foxglove’s out-of-the-box usability for real-time tasks such as motion planning, teleoperation, or interactive environment setup.

- **No some advanced features** Foxglove currently lack some advanced features found in `PlotJuggler`. For example, Foxglove does not yet support strict axis ratio locking — a critical feature when accurately visualizing spatial data where maintaining proportional relationships between axes matters. Additionally, Foxglove’s built-in data transformation capabilities are limited compared to PlotJuggler’s comprehensive suite of statistical and signal-processing tools, such as moving averages, derivatives, filtering, and custom mathematical expressions. These advanced features make PlotJuggler especially useful for detailed signal analysis and fine-grained data manipulation, which is often essential when debugging sensor data or control signals.

- **No automated anomaly detection**: Foxglove Studio does not include built-in automated validation or anomaly detection features. It does not use ML models or rule-based systems to automatically flag issues. Instead, it offers detailed message introspection and customizable visualizations that enable users to manually identify irregularities such as NaNs, infinities, or out-of-range values. This hands-on approach requires user expertise but provides flexible, in-depth analysis without automated alerts.

### **Rerun**

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Real-time and Recorded Data Visualization**: Rerun supports both live-streamed and recorded sensor data visualization with minimal latency. It ingests data via Rust- or Python-based logging SDKs, handling a wide range of robotics sensor modalities including 3D spatial data, camera imagery, numeric time-series, semantic segmentation maps, depth maps, annotations (bounding boxes, keypoints), and textual or categorical event data. Recorded datasets can be replayed with full timeline control for stepwise inspection or smooth playback, aiding in bug reproduction and model validation.

- **Collaboration and Sharing Features**. Rerun streamlines collaborative workflows by offering data export and session sharing via `.rrd` files. Teams can share recorded `.rrd` files for offline inspection, annotate data using Annotation Context (which supports labeling via class IDs and color mapping), and use shared Recording IDs to log streams from multiple processes or machines into a unified session, provided the Recording ID is set consistently at the time of logging, enabling live, unified logging. It is important to note that merging previously recorded `.rrd` files with different Recording IDs offline is currently not supported. Additionally, users can export screenshots for inclusion in reports or dashboards via CLI or viewer options, depending on the version and available commands.

- **Customizable and Extensible UI**: The Rerun Viewer offers a modular, layout-aware interface designed for workflows such as SLAM debugging, multi-sensor calibration, and performance profiling. Users can save and reload “Blueprints” — serialized UI configurations that preserve panel layouts, timelines, selected entities, and styling (color, transparency, size). The Viewer exposes a full styling hierarchy (override → store → default → fallback), allowing easy customization of visuals without altering source data. Multiple synchronized views (3D scenes, timelines, 2D plots, raw data inspectors) support comprehensive analysis.

  Developers can extend functionality by creating custom egui-based panels, entity-aware views, or embedding the Viewer within Rust applications using the `re_viewer` crate. Custom data loaders and visualization types can be added for proprietary or specialized formats. Interactive tools such as selection, pinning, and hover highlighting assist detailed exploration. The Viewer supports interactive callbacks for events like hover, selection, and context menu actions, enabling highly tailored, real-time data interactions.

- **Rich 3D Visualization with Spatial Context**: Built on `egui` and `WGPU`, Rerun’s 3D viewer efficiently renders large-scale scenes on consumer hardware. It uses an entity-path-based scene graph that reflects the hierarchical kinematic tree, allowing intuitive navigation and inspection of components, sensor frames, trajectories, bounding boxes, segmentation masks, dense point clouds, annotated images, 3D meshes, and time-series plots. Users can customize visual parameters such as color maps, visibility, annotations, and rendering modes while navigating via orbit, zoom, and pan controls.

- **Flexible Time-Series and Event Logging**: Rerun features synchronized timeline playback for multiple streams, supporting both explicit (user-defined) and implicit (auto-derived) timestamps. It manages multiple time domains (logical/log time and timeline time) to synchronize heterogeneous data sources accurately. Timeline controls include zooming, scrubbing, filtering by entity path or timeline, and detailed event inspection with rich metadata. Conditional filtering and selective visibility help isolate anomalies or relevant events in complex multi-agent or multi-sensor deployments.

- **Programmable Data Access and Web Integration**. The Rerun SDK provides semantic logging primitives (e.g., `log_scalar`, `log_image`, `log_point_cloud`, `log_text_entry`, `log_tensor`) that automatically render in the Viewer. Rerun uses Apache Arrow for efficient data handling, supporting advanced analysis with tools like Pandas and Jupyter, direct export to formats like `Parquet` is supported via the API, enabling both streaming visualization and offline batch analysis. The Viewer is also available as a React component, enabling seamless embedding within React applications and custom web dashboards, though integration with other JavaScript frameworks may require additional adaptation.

  Underneath these features, Rerun’s flexible and scalable logging is powered by an Entity-Component-System (ECS) data model, which organizes time-stamped components attached to hierarchical entities to maintain performance and extensibility.

- **Emerging Features**: Experimental capabilities include graph-based views for visualizing system architectures, connectivity, and agent interactions, extending Rerun’s utility beyond traditional sensor data visualization into system design and research workflows.

**Limitations**:

- **No Built-in Advanced Analytics**: Rerun focuses primarily on visualization and lacks integrated statistical analysis, anomaly detection, or expression-based plotting features. In contrast, Foxglove offers richer analytics including expression plots and integration with monitoring systems like Prometheus.

- **Not Optimized for Live Robot Control**: Although supporting real-time data streaming, Rerun is not designed for robot teleoperation or control input interaction. RViz and Foxglove provide more mature support for monitoring and interacting with live robots.

- **No Native Support for Navigation and SLAM Maps**: Unlike RViz, Rerun does not natively visualize occupancy grids, costmaps, or SLAM results, limiting its use for path planning or localization workflows.

- **Limited Real-Time Collaboration**: While supporting offline session sharing, Rerun lacks live multi-user collaboration features such as synchronized remote views or cloud-hosted live sessions found in Foxglove.

- **Limited Visualization of Large-Scale System Architectures**: Rerun’s entity-based model focuses on spatial and temporal data and does not yet provide comprehensive tools for exploring complex system communication graphs or architecture diagrams interactively.

## **Conclusion**
