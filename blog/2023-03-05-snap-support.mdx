By making ReductStore available on the Snap Store, users can now easily install and manage ReductStore on various Linux distributions.

Snap is a universal package manager developed by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu Linux. It allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a single package that can be installed on any Linux distribution that supports snap, without worrying about different packaging formats and dependency conflicts.

To install ReductStore using snap, first make sure that `snapd` is installed on your system. You can install `snapd` on Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions using the following command:

```
$ sudo apt install snapd
```

Once `snapd` is installed, you can install ReductStore using the following command:

```
$ sudo snap install reductstore
```

This will download and install the latest version of ReductStore from [**the snap store**](https://snapcraft.io/reductstore).

After the installation is complete, you can see the database running as a service:

```
$ snap services reductstore
```

Once installed, users can access the database through the built-in web console by opening their browser and navigating to http://localhost:8383.
Alternatively, they can use the [**Reduct CLI**](https://cli.reduct.store) for more advanced management and querying of the database.

Moreover, you can manage ReductStore's settings using the `snap set/get` commands:

```
$ snap get reductstore
$ snap set reductstore log_level=DEBUG
$ snap logs reductstore 
```

I hope you find this release useful. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to use the [**ReductStore Community**](https://community.reduct.store) forum.

Thanks for using [**ReductStore**](https://www.reduct.store)!
