Hello everyone,

We're excited to announce the release
of [**version 0.5.0 of the Reduct CLI**](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cli/releases/tag/v0.5.0)!
This release brings a number of new features to improve data export and mirroring. Here are the highlights:


### Limit parallel tasks

We added a global option `--parallel` to limit the number of entries to be exported or mirrored in parallel. This can be
useful when a bucket has a large number of entries and the network connection is slow. Usage example:

```
rcli export --parallel 5 folder server_1/bucket_1 . 
```

{/* truncate */}

### Export or mirror specific entries

Now you have a new option `--entries` to mirror or export some specific entries. This can be useful when you want to
mirror or export only a subset of entries in a bucket:

```
rcli mirror server_1/bucket_1 server_2/bucket --entries=entry_1,entry_2,entry_3
```

### Graceful stop

We added graceful stop for long-running operations. This means that if you interrupt the `mirror` or `export` commands,
they will finish mirroring the current entry and then exit.


To update to the latest version of the Reduct CLI, use the following command:

```
pip install -U reduct-cli
```
