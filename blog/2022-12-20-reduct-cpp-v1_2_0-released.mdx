We are excited to announce the release
of [**ReductStore Client SDK for C++ v1.2.0**](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cpp/releases/tag/v1.2.0)! This release
includes updated
documentation after we renamed the project from "Reduct Storage" to "ReductStore", and supports [ReductStore HTTP API
1.2.0](/docs/http-api) with the endpoint `GET /api/v1/me`.

<!--truncate-->

One of the useful features of the ReductStore Client SDK is the ability to retrieve information about the authenticated
user using the `IClient::Me method`. Here is an example of how to use this method:

```cpp
#include <reduct/client.h>

#include <iostream>

using reduct::IBucket;
using reduct::IClient;

int main() {
  auto client = IClient::Build("https://play.reduct.store", {.api_token="my-token"});
  auto [token_info, err] = client->Me();
  if (err) {
    std::cerr << err << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }
  
  std::cout << token_info.full_access << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

```
