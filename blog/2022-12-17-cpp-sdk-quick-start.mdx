This guide will help you get started with the [**ReductStore C++ SDK**](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cpp).

## Requirements

The ReductStore C++ SDK is written in C++20 and uses CMake as a build system. To install it, you will need:

* C++ compiler with C++20 support (we use GCC-11.2)
* cmake 3.18 or higher
* conan 1.40 or higher (it is optional, but [**conan**](https://conan.io) is a convenient package manager)

Currently, we have only tested the SDK on Linux AMD64, but if you need to port it to another
operating system or platform, you can create an [**issue**](https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cpp/issues/new/choose)
for assistance.

## Installing

To install the ReductStore C++ SDK, follow these steps:

<!--truncate-->

```
git clone https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cpp.git
cd reduct-cpp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```

## Simple Application

Let's create a simple C++ application that connects to the storage, creates a bucket, and writes and reads some data. We
will need two files: `CMakeLists.txt` and `main.cc`.

```
touch CMakeLists.txt main.cc
```

Here is the `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

project(ReductCppExamples)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)


find_package(ReductCpp 1.1.0)
find_package(ZLIB)
find_package(OpenSSL)

add_executable(usage-example usage_example.cc)
target_link_libraries(usage-example ${REDUCT_CPP_LIBRARIES} ${ZLIB_LIBRARIES} OpenSSL::SSL OpenSSL::Crypto)

```

And here is the code in `main.cc`:

```cpp
#include <reduct/client.h>

#include <iostream>

using reduct::IBucket;
using reduct::IClient;

int main() {
  auto client = IClient::Build("http://127.0.0.1:8383");

  // Get information about the server
  auto [info, err] = client->GetInfo();
  if (err) {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << err;
    return -1;
  }

  std::cout << "Server version: " << info.version;
  // Create a bucket
  auto [bucket, create_err] = client->GetOrCreateBucket("bucket");
  if (create_err) {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << create_err;
    return -1;
  }

  // Write some data
  IBucket::Time start = IBucket::Time::clock::now();
  [[maybe_unused]] auto write_err = bucket->Write("entry-1", {}, [](auto rec) { rec->WriteAll("some_data1"); });
  write_err = bucket->Write("entry-1", {}, [](auto rec) { rec->WriteAll("some_data2"); });
  write_err = bucket->Write("entry-1", {}, [](auto rec) { rec->WriteAll("some_data3"); });

  // Walk through the data
  err = bucket->Query("entry-1", start, IBucket::Time::clock::now(), std::nullopt, [](auto&& record) {
    std::string blob;
    auto read_err = record.Read([&blob](auto chunk) {
      blob.append(chunk);
      return true;
    });

    if (!read_err) {
      std::cout << "Read blob: " << blob;
    }

    return true;
  });
}


```

To compile the example, use the following commands:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Before you can run the example, you will need to start the storage as a Docker container:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383  reductstorage/engine:latest
```

You can then run the example with the following command:

```
./usage-example
```

## Next Steps

You can find more detailed documentation and examples
in [**the Reference API section**](https://cpp.reduct.store/en/latest/docs/api_reference/). You can also
refer to the [**ReductStore HTTP API**](/docs/http-api) documentation for a complete reference
of the available API calls.
