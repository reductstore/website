# Entry API to Delete Data

The API provides several endpoints for deleting data from an **[entry](../../glossary#entry)** in the database. It can be an entire entry, a specific **[record](../../glossary#record)**, a batch of records in a single request or records within a time range.

## Remove a Record from an Entry

The method removes a record from an entry or the entire entry.

:::danger
If the `ts` query parameter is set, the record with the timestamp is removed.
Otherwise, the entire entry is removed.
:::

If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read access to the entry's **[bucket](../../glossary#bucket)**.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.6: initially, the method removed only the entire entry.
- Version 1.12: the method can remove a record with a specific timestamp by setting the `ts` query parameter.

## Remove a Batch of Records from an Entry

The method removes a batch of records from an entry. The list of records to remove is sent in the headers of
the request. See [the Batch Protocol](/docs/http-api/entry-api/index.mdx#batch-protocol) section for more details.

If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read access to the entry's bucket.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.12: the method was introduced.

            },
        ]}

## Remove Records within a Time Range

The method removes records within a time range from an entry. The time range is specified in the query
parameters.
The method can return errors for specific records that were not removed in the response headers according to
the [Batch Protocol](/docs/http-api/entry-api/index.mdx#batch-protocol).

Additionally, you can specify filters to remove only records that match the filter criteria.

If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read access to the entry's bucket.

**Changes**:

- Version 1.12: the method was introduced.

:::warning
Since version 1.13, the method is deprecated. Use the [**Query API**](/docs/http-api/entry-api/run_query.mdx) instead.
