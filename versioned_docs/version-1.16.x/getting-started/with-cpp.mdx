## Installing the C++ SDK

<InstallSdk>
    The ReductStore C++ **[SDK](../glossary#sdk)** requires the following dependencies:

    * GCC >= 11.4 (support C++20)
    * CMake >= 3.22
    * ZLib
    * OpenSSL >= 3.0

    The easiest way to start using the C++ SDK is to integrate it into your project using CMake:

    ```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

    project(ReductCppExample)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

    include(FetchContent)

    # Enable using fetchcontent for reductcpp dependencies
    set(REDUCT_CPP_USE_FETCHCONTENT ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    FetchContent_Declare(
            reductcpp
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cpp
            GIT_TAG main
    )
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(reductcpp)

    add_executable(quick_start quick_start.cc)
    target_link_libraries(quick_start reductcpp::reductcpp)
    ```

</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Hello World Example

<UsingSdkSection example={QuickStart} language="cpp" />

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create a ReductStore client, you can use the `IClient::Build` fabric method from the `reduct` namespace. Pass the URL of the
    ReductStore instance you want to connect to as an argument to the method.

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=1. end=2.
    ```

</CreateClientSection>

## Creating a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>
    To create a **[bucket](../glossary#bucket)**, you should use the `GetOrCreateBucket` method on a `Client` instance. Pass the name of the bucket
    you want to create as an argument, along with settings.  If the bucket already exists, the `GetOrCreateBucket`
    method will return it:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=2. end=3.
    ```

</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped **[record](../glossary#record)** to an **[entry](../glossary#entry)** in a bucket, you should use the `Write` method on a `Bucket` instance.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument, along with the timestamp you want to write.
    Additionally, you can provide labels to the record to make it easier to query later.

    The `Write` method will call a callback function with the `WritableRecord` instance to write to the entry:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=3. end=4.
    ```

</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `Query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the entry to iterate over, and `start` and `stop` arguments to specify the time interval.You can also
    provide a `when` condition to filter records based on labels. Read more about the query syntax in the [**Conditional Query Reference**](../conditional-query/index.mdx).

    The method will return a callback function with the `ReadableRecord` instance for each record in the time range:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=4. end=5.
    ```

</DataQueryingSection>
