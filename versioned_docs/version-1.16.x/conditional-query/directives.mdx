# Directives

**[Directives](../glossary#directive)** are special instructions in conditional queries that modify how the query engine processes results.
They are prefixed with `#` and can be used to control aspects such as including additional records before or after those that match a given condition.

The following directives are supported:

| Operator         | ReductStore Version | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#ctx_before`    | v1.16               | Add additional records before each matching record as context, either by count or time window. |
| `#ctx_after`     | v1.16               | Add additional records after each matching record as context, either by count or time window.  |
| `#select_labels` | v1.16               | Retain only the specified labels in a record after filtering.                                  |
| `#ext`           | v1.17               | Contains query parameters for extensions that process data during querying.                    |

## `#ctx_before`

The `#ctx_before` directive allows you to include extra records that occurred **before** each matching record.
This is useful when you want context around a matched condition, such as to see what led up to it.

### Syntax

```
{
  "#ctx_before": <expression as int> | <duration literal>
}
```

### Behavior

- If the expression is an **integer**, it is interpreted as the number of records to include before each match.
- If the expression is a **duration literal** (e.g. `"1s"`, `"10m"`, `"500ms"`), it is interpreted as a time window to include records within that period before each match.

### Examples

By number of records:

```json
{
  "#ctx_before": 10
}
```

By time duration:

```json
{
  "#ctx_before": "1h"
}
```

## `#ctx_after`

The `#ctx_after` directive allows you to include extra records that occur **after** each matching record.
This is useful when you want to examine consequences or outcomes following a detected condition.

### Syntax

```
{
  "#ctx_after": <expression as int> | <duration literal>
}
```

### Behavior

- If the expression is an **integer**, it is interpreted as the number of records to include after each match.
- If the expression is a **duration literal**, it is interpreted as a time window to include records within that period after each match.

### Examples

By number of records:

```json
{
  "#ctx_after": 5
}
```

By time duration:

```json
{
  "#ctx_after": "30s"
}
```

## `#select_labels`

The `#select_labels` directive allows you to filter the labels retained in each record after applying the query.

### Syntax

```
{
  "#select_labels": [<label name 1>, <label name 2>, ...]
}
```

### Behavior

This directive is applied after all other query processing, including context inclusion and filtering.

:::info
The `#select_labels` directive is ignored in replication conditional queries.
:::

### Example

```json
{
  "#select_labels": ["temperature", "humidity"]
}
```

## `#ext`

The `#ext` directive is used to specify parameters for \*\*[extensions](../../glossary#extension) that process data during querying.

### Syntax

```
{
  "#ext": {
    "<extension_name>": { <extension_parameters> }
  }
}
```

### Behavior

The `#ext` directive allows you to pass configuration options to an extension that will process the data as part of the query.
The specific parameters depend on the extension being used. Read more about the official extensions in the [**Extensions Documentation**](../extensions/index).

:::info
The `#ext` directive is ignored in replication conditional queries.
:::

### Example

```json
{
  "#ext": {
    "select": {
      "columns": [{ "index": 0, "as_label": "speed" }]
    }
  }
}
```
