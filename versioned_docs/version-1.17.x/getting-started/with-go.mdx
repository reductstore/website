## Installing the Go SDK

<InstallSdk>
    To start using the ReductStore Go **[SDK](../glossary#sdk)**, add the sdk to your `go.mod` file:

    ```go
    go get github.com/reductstore/reduct-go
    ```

    Then, import the `reduct-go` package in your Go code:

    ```go
    import reduct "github.com/reductstore/reduct-go"
    ```

</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create a ReductStore client, you should use the `reduct.NewClient` method from the `reduct_go` package.
    You must pass the URL of the ReductStore server as an argument and specify the client options using the `reduct.ClientOptions` struct:

    ```go file=../examples/go/src/quick_start.go start=1. end=2.
    ```

</CreateClientSection>

## Creating a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>
    To create a **[bucket](../glossary#bucket)**, you can use the `CreateOrGetBucket` or `CreateBucket` methods on a `Client` instance. The method takes the name of
    the bucket you want to create as an argument and setting. The settings are optional, and you can customize them using the `BucketSettingBuilder` struct as shown below:

    ```go file=../examples/go/src/quick_start.go start=2. end=3.
    ```

</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped **[record](../glossary#record)** to an **[entry](../glossary#entry)** in a bucket, you should use the `BeginWrite` method on a `Bucket` instance.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument and options to specify the timestamp and labels for the record.
    The method returns a `WritableRecord` instance to write record content to the entry:

    ```go file=../examples/go/src/quick_start.go start=3. end=4.
    ```

</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records within a specified time range, you should use the `Query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the entry to iterate over and query options to specify the time range. Use the `QueryBuilder` to build the query options.
    You can also provide a condition to filter records based on labels using the `WithWhen` method.
    Read more about the query syntax in the [**Conditional Query Reference**](../conditional-query/index.mdx).

    When the query is executed, it returns a `QueryResult` object that you can iterate over to access the records:

    ```go file=../examples/go/src/quick_start.go start=4.
    ```

</DataQueryingSection>
