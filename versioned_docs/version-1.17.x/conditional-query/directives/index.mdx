# Directives

**[Directives](../glossary#directive)** are special instructions in conditional queries that modify how the query engine processes results.
They are prefixed with `#` and can be used to control aspects such as including additional records before or after those that match a given condition.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
