# Entry API Specification Reference

The Entry API allows users to write and read data from their buckets, as well as search for specific entries using query operations.

<SwaggerComponent
  method="POST"
  path="/api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name"
  summary="Write a record to an entry"
  description={
    <>
      ReductStore creates an entry on the first write operation. The record
      should be placed in the body of the HTTP request. The body can also be
      empty.
      <br />
      <br />
      The method needs a valid API token with write access to the entry's bucket
      if authentication is enabled.
      <br />
      <br />
      The endpoint can be used with the "Expect: 100-continue" header. If the
      header is not set and an error occurs on the database side, the database
      drains the sent body and returns an HTTP status.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since version 1.3, the database supports labels. You can assign any number
      of labels to a record by using headers that start with{" "}
      <code>x-reduct-label-</code>.

  description={
    <>
      This method allows multiple records to be written in a single request. A
      client should describe the records in headers in the following format:
      <br />
      <code>
        x-reduct-time-: &lt;CONTENT_LENGTH&gt;,&lt;CONTENT_TYPE&gt;,
        [LABEL=VALUE]

      For example:{" "}
      <code>x-reduct-time-192312381273: 100,text/plain,x=y,a="[a,b]"</code>
      <br />
      <br />
      The body must contain the concatenated records sorted by timestamp. The
      method returns an HTTP error if the header format or data length is
      incorrect. It also returns an individual status and error message for each
      record if the write operation fails:
      <br />
      <code>x-reduct-error-: &lt;STATUS_CODE&gt;,&lt;ERROR_MESSAGE&gt;.</code>

      The method finds a record for the given timestamp and sends its content in
      the HTTP response body. It also sends additional information in headers:

      <strong>x-reduct-time</strong> - UNIX timestamp of the record in
      microseconds

      <strong>x-reduct-last</strong> - 1 - if a record is the last record in the

      Since version 1.5, ReductStore provides a way to read multiple records in
      a request. This can improve latency when you have many small records to
      read. The endpoint sorts all the records by time and concatenates them
      into a blob and sends it in the body. The meta information is sent for
      each record as a separate header{" "}
      <code>x-reduct-time-&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> which has a value as a CSV
      row. An example:
      <br />
      <code>x-reduct-time-192312381273: 100,text/plain,x=y,a="[a,b]"</code>
      <br />
      The first value is content-length, the second one is content-type, then
      labels as key=value pairs. If there is a comma in the value, it is escaped
      with double quotes.

description={
  <>
    The method responds with a JSON document containing an ID which should be used to read records with the following endpoint:
      <p>
        <strong>GET /b/:bucket_name/:entry_name?q=ID.</strong>
      </p>
    The time interval is [start, stop).
    <br />
    If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read access to the bucket of the entry.
    <br /><br />
    <strong> Changes: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Version 1.3: the method also provides the <code>include-&lt;label&gt;</code> and <code>exclude-&lt;label&gt;</code> query parameters to filter records based on the values of certain labels. For example:
            <p>
                <strong>GET /api/v1/:bucket/:entry/q?include-&lt;label1&gt;=foo&amp;exclude-&lt;label2&gt;=bar</strong>
            </p>
            This would find all records that have <code>label1</code> equal to "foo" and excludes those that have <code>label2</code> equal to "bar".
            <br />
            A user can specify multiple <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> labels, which will be connected with an AND operator. For example:
            <p>
                <strong>GET /api/v1/:bucket/:entry/q?include-&lt;label1&gt;=foo&amp;include-&lt;label2&gt;=bar</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
    <li>
            Version 1.4: the method has the <code>continuous query</code> flag. If it is true, the current query will not be discarded if there are no records. A client can ask them later. The query will not be removed until its TTL has expired. The <code>stop</code> parameter is ignored for continuous queries.
    </li>
    <li>
            Version 1.6: the method provides the <code>limit</code> query parameter. It limits the number of records in the query. If it is not set, the query is unlimited by default.
    </li>
    <li>
            Version 1.10: the method has the <code>each_n</code> and <code>each_s</code> query parameters. If the <code>each_n</code> parameter is set, the method returns only every <code>each_n</code>-th record. If the <code>each_s</code> parameter is set, the method returns only one record per <code>each_s</code> seconds.
    </li>
    </ul>
