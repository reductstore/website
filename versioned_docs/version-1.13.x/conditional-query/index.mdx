Conditional Query is a query language based on JSON syntax that allows you to filter records in ReductStore using labels and their values.

The query language is used in the [**query endpoint**](/docs/http-api/entry-api/run_query.mdx) of the HTTP API.
You can also find usage examples with many SDKs and tools in the [**Data Querying**](/docs/guides/data-querying.mdx) and
in the [**Data Management**](/docs/guides/data-management.mdx) guides.

## Query Syntax

The query object is a JSON object containing one or more conditions, a condition can be nested and have a tree-like structure.
Queries can be written in two main notations: object notation and array notation. Each has its own strengths and trade-offs.
In addition, a special naming convention is used to extend the JSON syntax.

### Object notation

A condition is a key-value pair, where the key is the label reference and the value is an object with the operator and operand:

```json
{
  "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 }
}
```

The object notation is the most common and easiest to read and write, but it has the limitation that you can't have more than two operands in a condition, and the first must be the label reference.

### Array notation

A condition is a key-value pair where the key is the operator and the value is an array with its operands:

```json
{
  "$gt": ["&label_name", 10]
}
```

The array notation is more flexible and allows you to have more than two operands in a condition, but it looks more complex.

### Multiple conditions

The query object can contain multiple conditions that are linked using the AND operator:

```json
{
  "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 },
  "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 }
}
```

This is the same as:

```json
{
  "$and": [{ "&label_name": { "$gt": 10 } }, { "&label_name": { "$lt": 20 } }]
}
```

### JSON Extension

The queries use a special naming convention for labels and operators to extend the JSON syntax with additional functionality:

| Type     | Convention    | Description                                          |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Label    | "&label_name" | Reference to a label in the record starting with `&` |
| Operator | "$operator"   | Reference to an operator starting with `$`           |
| Constant | JSON types    | A constant value in the query, e.g. `10`, `"string"` |

## Type System

### Supported Types

The conditional query language supports a simple type system with four types: **boolean**, **integer**, **float**, and **string**:

| Type    | Size   | Description                                     |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| boolean | 1      | Boolean value can be `true` or `false`          |
| integer | 8      | Signed 64-bit integer                           |
| float   | 8      | IEEE-754 double-precision floating-point number |
| string  | 1-2^16 | UTF-8 encoded string                            |

### Type Inference

The storage engine stores a label as a string without any type information, so the query engine tries to infer the type of the label based on its value:

1. If a label has a value of true or false, it is converted to a boolean.
2. If a label has a number without a decimal point, it is converted to an integer.
3. If a label has a number with a decimal point, it is converted to a float.
4. If all other conversions fail, it is converted to a string.

### Type Casting

During the execution of the query, the engine will try to cast types of operands to the same type.
Logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, `$not` will cast the result to a boolean.
Comparison and arithmetic operators will cast the operands to the most precise type in the following order:

|             | boolean | integer | float | string |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| **boolean** | boolean | integer | float | -      |
| **integer** | integer | integer | float | -      |
| **float**   | float   | float   | float | -      |
| **string**  | -       | -       | -     | string |

## Operators

The conditional query language supports many operators for comparison, arithmetic, and logical operations.
