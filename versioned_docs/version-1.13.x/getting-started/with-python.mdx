## Installing the Python SDK

<InstallSdk>
    To install the ReductStore SDK, you will need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. Once Python is
    installed, you can use the `pip` package manager to install the `reduct-py` package:

    ```
    pip install reduct-py
    ```

</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Hello World Example

<UsingSdkSection example={QuickStart} language="Python" />

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create a ReductStore client, you can use the `Client` class from the `reduct` module. Pass the URL of the
    ReductStore instance you want to connect to as an argument to the `Client` constructor. To reuse the same HTTP
    session and improve performance, you can use the context manager:

    ```python file=../examples/py/src/quick_start.py start=1. end=2.
    ```

</CreateClientSection>

## Creating a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>
    To create a bucket, you should use the `create_bucket` method on a `Client` instance. Pass the name of the bucket
    you want to create as an argument, along with settings. You can set the `exist_ok` argument to True to get the
    bucket if it already exists:

    ```python file=../examples/py/src/quick_start.py start=2. end=3.
    ```

</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped record to an entry in a bucket, you should use the `write` method on a `Bucket` instance.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument, along with the data and timestamp you want to write.
    Additionally, you can provide labels to the record to make it easier to query later.

    The `write` method will create the `sensor-1` entry if it doesn't exist and write the record to it:

    ```python file=../examples/py/src/quick_start.py start=3. end=4.
    ```

</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the record to iterate over, and `start` and `stop` arguments to specify the time interval. You can also
    provide a `when` condition to filter records based on labels. Read more about the query syntax in
    the [**Conditional Query Reference**](../conditional-query/index.mdx).

    The `query` method returns an async iterator over the records in the entry:

    ```python file=../examples/py/src/quick_start.py start=4. end=5.
    ```

</DataQueryingSection>
