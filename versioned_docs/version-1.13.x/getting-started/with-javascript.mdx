## Installing the JavaScript SDK

<InstallSdk>
    To install the **[SDK](../glossary#sdk)**, you will only need `npm` or `yarn`. You can install the SDK by using the following
    command:

    ```
    npm install reduct-js
    ```

</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

<RunReductStore />

## Hello World Example

<UsingSdkSection example={QuickStart} language="JavaScript" />

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create the client, you can use the `Client` class from the `reduct-js` package. Pass the URL of the
    ReductStore instance you want to connect to as an argument to the `Client` constructor.

    ```javascript file=../examples/js/src/quick_start.mjs start=1. end=2.
    ```

</CreateClientSection>

## Creating a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>
    To create a **[bucket](../glossary#bucket)**, you should use the `getOrCreateBucket` method on a `Client` instance. Pass the name of the
    bucket you want to create as an argument, along with settings. If the bucket already exists, the `getOrCreateBucket`
    method will return it.

    ```javascript file=../examples/js/src/quick_start.mjs start=2. end=3.
    ```

</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped **[record](../glossary#record)** to an **[entry](../glossary#entry)** in a bucket, you should use the `beginWrite` method on a `Bucket` object.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument, along with the data and timestamp you want to write.
    Additionally, you can provide labels to the record to make it easier to query later.

    The `beginWrite` method will create the `sensor-1` entry if it doesn't exist and return a `WritableRecord` object.
    The `WritableRecord` object can be used to send the data to the database:

    ```javascript file=../examples/js/src/quick_start.mjs start=3. end=4.
    ```

    Pay attention that the time is a UNIX time in microseconds. This the reason why we use BigInt to represent it.

</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the entry to iterate over, and `start` and `stop` arguments to specify the time interval. You can also
    provide a `when` condition to filter records based on labels. Read more about the query syntax in
    the [**Conditional Query Reference**](../conditional-query/index.mdx).

    The `query` method returns an async iterator over the records in the entry:

    ```javascript file=../examples/js/src/quick_start.mjs start=4.
    ```

</DataQueryingSection>
