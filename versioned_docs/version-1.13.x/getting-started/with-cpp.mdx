## Installing the C++ SDK

<InstallSdk>
    The ReductStore C++ **[SDK](../glossary#sdk)** requires the following dependencies:

    * GCC 11.2 or higher (support C++20)
    * CMake 3.18 or higher
    * ZLib
    * OpenSSL 1.1 or 3.0
    * Conan 1.58 (optionally)

    To install the ReductStore C++ SDK, follow these steps:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/reductstore/reduct-cpp.git
    cd reduct-cpp
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    cmake --build .
    sudo cmake --build . --target install
    ```

    CMake tries to use the `conan` package manager if it is installed. If it isn't, it downloads all the dependencies by using
    FetchContent. To use ReductStore SDK you need only to use `find_pacakge` in your cmake lists:

    After installing the SDK, you need to link the `ReductCpp` library to your project. The following example shows how
    to do this using CMake:

    ```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

    project(ReductCppExample)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

    find_package(ZLIB)
    find_package(OpenSSL)


    find_package(ReductCpp)

    add_executable(quick_start quick_start.cc)
    target_link_libraries(quick_start ${REDUCT_CPP_LIBRARIES} ${ZLIB_LIBRARIES} OpenSSL::SSL OpenSSL::Crypto)
    ```

</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Hello World Example

<UsingSdkSection example={QuickStart} language="cpp" />

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create a ReductStore client, you can use the `IClient::Build` fabric method from the `reduct` namespace. Pass the URL of the
    ReductStore instance you want to connect to as an argument to the method.

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=1. end=2.
    ```

</CreateClientSection>

## Creating a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>
    To create a **[bucket](../glossary#bucket)**, you should use the `GetOrCreateBucket` method on a `Client` instance. Pass the name of the bucket
    you want to create as an argument, along with settings.  If the bucket already exists, the `GetOrCreateBucket`
    method will return it:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=2. end=3.
    ```

</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped **[record](../glossary#record)** to an **[entry](../glossary#entry)** in a bucket, you should use the `Write` method on a `Bucket` instance.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument, along with the timestamp you want to write.
    Additionally, you can provide labels to the record to make it easier to query later.

    The `Write` method will call a callback function with the `WritableRecord` instance to write to the entry:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=3. end=4.
    ```

</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `Query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the entry to iterate over, and `start` and `stop` arguments to specify the time interval.You can also
    provide a `when` condition to filter records based on labels. Read more about the query syntax in the [**Conditional Query Reference**](../conditional-query/index.mdx).

    The method will return a callback function with the `ReadableRecord` instance for each record in the time range:

    ```cpp file=../examples/cpp/src/quick_start.cc start=4. end=5.
    ```

</DataQueryingSection>
