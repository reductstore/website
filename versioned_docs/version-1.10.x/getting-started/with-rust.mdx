## Installing the Rust SDK

<InstallSdk>
    To start using the ReductStore Rust SDK, add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    reduct-rs = "1"
    ```

    Then, import the `reduct-rs` crate in your Rust code:
</InstallSdk>

## Running ReductStore

## Creating a Client

<CreateClientSection>
    To create a ReductStore client, you can use the `ReductClient::builder()` method from the `reduct_rs` crate to create a builder
    instance. You must pass the URL of the ReductStore server as an argument to the `ClientBuilder::new()` method.
    Then, call the `build()` method on the builder instance to create a `Client` instance:

    ```rust file=../examples/rs/examples/quick_start.rs start=1. end=2.
    ```
</CreateClientSection>

## Creating a Bucket

<CreateBucketSection>
    To create a bucket, you should use the `create_bucket` method on a `Client` instance. The method takes the name of
    the bucket you want to create as an argument and returns a `BucketBuilder` instance to configure the bucket settings.
    Call the `send` method on the `BucketBuilder` to send the request to the ReductStore server and create the bucket:

    ```rust file=../examples/rs/examples/quick_start.rs start=2. end=3.
    ```
</CreateBucketSection>

## Data Ingestion

<DataIngestionSection>
    To write a timestamped record to an entry in a bucket, you should use the `write_record` method on a `Bucket` instance.
    Pass the name of the entry you want to write to as an argument. The method will return a `RecordBuilder` instance to
    pass the data and timestamp you want to write. Call the `send` method on the `RecordBuilder` to send the request to
    the ReductStore server and write the record:

    ```rust file=../examples/rs/examples/quick_start.rs start=3. end=4.
    ```
</DataIngestionSection>

## Data Querying

<DataQueryingSection>
    To iterate over all records in a given time range, you should use the `query` method on a bucket instance. Pass the
    name of the entry to iterate over. The method will return a `QueryBuilder` instance to specify the time interval.
    Call the `send` method on the `QueryBuilder` to send the request to the ReductStore server and return a stream of
    records:

    ```rust file=../examples/rs/examples/quick_start.rs start=4. end=5.
    ```
</DataQueryingSection>
