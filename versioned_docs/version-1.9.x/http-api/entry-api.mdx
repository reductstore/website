# Entry API


The Entry API allows users to write and read data from their buckets, as well as search for specific entries using query operations.

<SwaggerComponent
  method="POST"

  summary="Write a record to an entry"
  description={
    <>
      ReductStore creates an entry on the first write operation. The record should be placed in the body of the HTTP request. The body can also be empty.
      <br /><br />
      The method needs a valid API token with write access to the entry's bucket if authentication is enabled.
      <br /><br />
      The endpoint can be used with the "Expect: 100-continue" header. If the header is not set and an error occurs on the database side, the database drains the sent body and returns an HTTP status.
      <br /><br />
      Since version 1.3, the database supports labels. You can assign any number of labels to a record by using headers that start with <code>x-reduct-label-</code>.

  description={

      This method allows multiple records to be written in a single request. A client should describe the records in headers in the following format:
      <br />
      <code>x-reduct-time-: &lt;CONTENT_LENGTH&gt;,&lt;CONTENT_TYPE&gt;, [LABEL=VALUE]</code>
      <br /><br />
      For example: <code>x-reduct-time-192312381273: 100,text/plain,x=y,a="[a,b]"</code>
      <br /><br />
      The body must contain the concatenated records sorted by timestamp. The method returns an HTTP error if the header format or data length is incorrect. It also returns an individual status and error message for each record if the write operation fails:
      <br />
      <code>x-reduct-error-: &lt;STATUS_CODE&gt;,&lt;ERROR_MESSAGE&gt;.</code>

      The method finds a record for the given timestamp and sends its content in the HTTP response body. It also sends additional information in headers:
      <br /><strong>x-reduct-time</strong> - UNIX timestamp of the record in microseconds
      <br /><strong>x-reduct-last</strong> - 1 - if a record is the last record in the query (deprecated since version 1.4, use NoContent response)
      <br /><strong>x-reduct-label-&lt;name&gt;</strong> - a value of the &lt;name&gt; label

      If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read access to the entry's bucket.
      <br />
      Since version 1.3, the database supports labels. If a record has some labels, the method sends them as headers that start with <code>x-reduct-label</code>.

  description={
    <>
      Since version 1.5, ReductStore provides a way to read multiple records in a request. This can improve latency when you have many small records to read. The endpoint sorts all the records by time and concatenates them into a blob and sends it in the body. The meta information is sent for each record as a separate header <code>x-reduct-time-&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> which has a value as a CSV row. An example:
      <br />
      <code>x-reduct-time-192312381273: 100,text/plain,x=y,a="[a,b]"</code>
      <br />
      The first value is content-length, the second one is content-type, then labels as key=value pairs. If there is a comma in the value, it is escaped with double quotes.

      The endpoint works exactly as
      <br />
      <code>GET /api/v1/b/:bucket_name/:entry_name/batch</code>

<SwaggerComponent
  method="GET"

  summary="Query records for a time interval"
description={
  <>
    The method responds with a JSON document containing an ID which should be used to read records with the following endpoint:
    <br />
    <strong>GET /b/:bucket_name/:entry_name?q=ID.</strong>
    <br /><br />
    The time interval is [start, stop).
    <br /><br />
    If authentication is enabled, the method needs a valid API token with read access to the bucket of the entry.
    <br /><br />
    Since version 1.3, the method also provides the <code>include-&lt;label&gt;</code> and <code>exclude-&lt;label&gt;</code> query parameters to filter records based on the values of certain labels. For example:
    <br />
    <strong>GET /api/v1/:bucket/:entry/q?include-&lt;label1&gt;=foo&amp;exclude-&lt;label2&gt;=bar</strong>
    <br /><br />
    This would find all records that have <code>label1</code> equal to "foo" and excludes those that have <code>label2</code> equal to "bar".
    <br /><br />
    A user can specify multiple <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> labels, which will be connected with an AND operator. For example:
    <br />
    <strong>GET /api/v1/:bucket/:entry/q?include-&lt;label1&gt;=foo&amp;include-&lt;label2&gt;=bar</strong>
    <br /><br />
    Since version 1.4, the method has the <code>continuous query</code> flag. If it is true, the current query will not be discarded if there are no records. A client can ask them later. The query will not be removed until its TTL has expired. The <code>stop</code> parameter is ignored for continuous queries.
    <br /><br />
    Since version 1.6, the method provides the <code>limit</code> query parameter. It limits the number of records in the query. If it is not set, the query is unlimited by default.
