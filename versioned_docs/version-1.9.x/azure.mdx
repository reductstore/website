# üèóÔ∏è Azure Integration

## Overview

ReductStore is now available as an IoT Edge module on the **[**Azure Marketplace**](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps/reductstorellc1689939980623.reductstore)**, providing Azure customers with the ease of deploying ReductStore's time-series database for blob data on IoT Edge devices.

This guide provides instructions on how to deploy ReductStore directly to your IoT Edge devices using the Azure portal. 

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the deployment process, ensure that you have:

- An active Azure account. If you do not have one, you can **[**create an account for free**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)**.
- An existing IoT Hub in Azure. If you need to set up a new IoT Hub, follow the **[**Azure IoT Hub Documentation**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/)**.
- At least one registered IoT Edge device. For instructions on setting up an IoT Edge device, see the **[**Azure IoT Edge documentation**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/)**.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Access ReductStore on Azure Marketplace

Navigate to the **[**ReductStore listing on the Azure Marketplace**](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps/reductstorellc1689939980623.reductstore)**. 
This is your starting point for deploying ReductStore to your IoT environment.

### 2. Initiate Deployment

Click on "Get It Now" to start the deployment process. You will be prompted to sign in to your Azure account if you haven't already.

### 3. Select a Plan

Decide between the Community and Enterprise plans based on your requirements. 
The Community plan, free of charge for entities with finances below $2M, offers unrestricted usage and is open under the **[**Business Source License (BUSL-1.1)**](https://github.com/reductstore/reductstore/blob/main/LICENSE)**.
On the other hand, the Enterprise Edition, suitable for larger firms, includes unlimited usage, free development use, and storage-based pricing, along with continuous support and guidance. 

For more detailed information, please visit the **[**pricing page**](/pricing)**.

### 4. Configure Deployment Settings

- **Subscription:** Select the Azure subscription you wish to use.
- **Resource Group:** Choose an existing resource group or create a new one.
- **IoT Hub:** Select the IoT Hub connected to your IoT Edge devices.
- **Edge Device:** Choose the edge device where you want to deploy ReductStore.
- **Container Create Options:** Specify the settings for creating the container in the Azure IoT Edge module. At a minimum, these settings should include:

  ```json
  {
    "HostConfig": {
      "PortBindings": {
      "8383/tcp": [
        {
          "HostPort": "8383"
        }
      ]
    },
    "Binds": [
        "/absolute/path/to/your/folder:/data"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

:::tip
For defining the correct environment variables and additional configurations, refer to the **[**configuration page**](/docs/configuration)**.

### 5. Review and Create

Double-check your configurations and click "Create" to initiate the deployment. The process may take a few minutes to complete.

## Troubleshooting

Encounter issues? Here are a few common problems and their solutions:

- **Deployment Failures:** Check the Azure Activity Log for detailed error messages. Ensure your IoT Hub and Edge devices are correctly set up and online.
- **Connectivity Issues:** Verify that your network settings allow communication between your IoT Edge devices and ReductStore.
- **Missing Data:** Ensure that your data is being sent to the correct port and that the data is in the correct format. For more information, see the **[**HTTP API Reference**](/docs/http-api)**.
- **Performance Issues:** Check the CPU and memory usage of your IoT Edge device. If necessary, upgrade your device to a more powerful one.
- **Out of Memory Errors:** Setup a FIFO quota for your IoT Edge device to prevent it from running out of memory. For more information, see the **[**how-does-it-work page**](/docs/how-does-it-work)**.
