    question:
      "How does the database scale, and what are the infrastructure requirements for scaling up?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        ReductStore is built for scalability, designed to efficiently manage
        large data volumes typical in edge computing and AI/ML workflows. It
        combines blob and time-series data functionalities, enabling the system
        to handle billions of time-stamped blobs. Scaling up primarily involves
        expanding disk capacity. The system's architecture supports low-latency
        access with iterator and range query capabilities, ensuring optimal
        performance at scale. More information about the architecture can be
        found in the{" "}

    question:
      "Are there any customization options for data retention and replication policies?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes, ReductStore includes several customizable features for managing
        data, one of which is the First In, First Out (FIFO) approach. This
        method is specifically designed to handle data based on volume
        intervals, ensuring that as new entries are added, older ones are
        systematically removed to prevent disk space issues. Additionally, AI
        labels can be attached to blobs as metadata, helping in the
        identification and replication of key data, thus ensuring vital
        information is retained. These functionalities are all accessible
        through the{" "}

    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes, ReductStore ensures compatibility with a variety of programming
        languages via its HTTP(S) API. Being a blob storage system, it supports

        sensitive or regulated industries, and is well-suited for both edge
        computing and on-premise environments. It provides strict retention
        policy, token-based authorization for secure access, and data
        replication capabilities to facilitate disaster recovery. These features
        work together to align with industry standards and meet regulatory
        demands, ensuring the protection and integrity of your data.
