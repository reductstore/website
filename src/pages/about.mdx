# About ReductStore

ReductStore is a high-performance storage and streaming solution for data acquisition systems.
We built our engine from scratch to tackle the challenges of massive, real-time, unstructured data at the edge—where bandwidth is limited, devices are many, and speed is critical. Unlike traditional databases, ReductStore handles time-series records of any size—from logs and ROS bags to LiDAR, images, and vibration signals. Purpose-built for robotics, and industrial IoT (IIoT) ReductStore makes storing, streaming, and scaling data simple and reliable.
