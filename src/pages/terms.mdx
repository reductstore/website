The Customer must delete all copies of the Software and confirm deletion in writing.

**8.1. Confidential Information**
“Confidential Information” means any non-public, proprietary, or confidential information disclosed by one Party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other (“Receiving Party”) in connection with this Agreement, whether in written, oral, or electronic form, that is designated as confidential or should reasonably be understood to be confidential by its nature.

The Parties acknowledge that, under this Agreement, ReductSoftware does not process personal data on behalf of the Customer in the role of a data processor, as the Software is deployed on the Customer’s own infrastructure.

**9.2. Personal Data in Support**
To the extent that personal data is shared with ReductSoftware during the provision of Support Services (e.g., via support tickets or diagnostic logs), such processing shall be limited, incidental, and solely for the purpose of fulfilling support obligations under this Agreement.
