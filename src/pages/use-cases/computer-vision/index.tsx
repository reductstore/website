      <p>
        ReductStore's architecture is specifically designed for high FPS
        computer vision applications that generate large amounts of unstructured
        data such as images and video. For example, in scenarios where multiple
        cameras are processed by a single edge device, ReductStore can
        efficiently ingest, query, and manage each frame in a time series
        format, with each image or video frame associated with a timestamp. This
        gives computer vision models instant access to historical and real-time
        visual data, taking full advantage of disk speed for both read and write
        operations, making it ideal for high-throughput environments where
        performance is critical.

      <p>
        ReductStore is designed to handle and manage large amounts of
        unstructured data, with no limits on the size or type of data you can
        store. It allows the creation of multiple buckets, making it easy to
        store images, videos, AI models, or any other type of data in one place.
        This flexibility makes ReductStore an ideal solution for managing
        diverse datasets, ensuring that computer vision models and associated
        data can be stored together for streamlined workflows and continuous
        tracking of model iterations.

    title: "Storing AI Labels and Metadata for Every Record",
    description: (
      <p>
        ReductStore can store metadata, including AI labels, for any image or
        video in its database. For example, in object recognition tasks, an
        image can be tagged with AI-generated labels that specify object
        categories within bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or other visual
        characteristics. This labeling enables efficient storage of AI model
        output, making it easier to access and analyze inference results. By
        integrating metadata directly into the storage layer, ReductStore
        simplifies the data pipeline architecture, streamlining the handling of
        AI-generated insights and improving overall operational efficiency.

    title: "Data Replication With Label Filtering",
    description: (
      <p>
        Label filtering in data replication processes acts as an effective
        reduction strategy by ensuring that only essential data is synchronized
        across storage buckets, whether in the cloud or at the edge. This method
        is particularly valuable for reducing storage and bandwidth consumption
        in distributed systems where resources are limited. By filtering data
        based on AI labels or classifications, replication is targeted to
        include only the most critical images or videos. As a result, this
        selective approach minimizes unnecessary storage and network traffic,
        ensuring that both cloud and edge environments contain only the most
        relevant operational data.

    title: "Real-Time FIFO Quota for Image and Video Streams",
    description: (
      <p>
        ReductStore's unique real-time FIFO (first-in, first-out) quotas based
        on data volume enable efficient management of high-throughput image and
        video streams. As new data is added, the system automatically removes
        the oldest data, ensuring continuous storage availability without manual
        intervention. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios such as
        surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and industrial monitoring, where
        large data streams can quickly fill storage. By focusing on volume
        rather than arbitrary time limits, ReductStore's FIFO quotas optimize
        storage utilization and keep systems running smoothly in high-speed data
        environments.
