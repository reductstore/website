## I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that
cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect,
referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the
data you submit, along with the number of clicks.

Personal Information refers to data that can be used to personally identify or contact you. 
This includes your email address, name, and company details, which you may provide to us via forms on our Site.

### 1. Information collected via Technology

In order to enhance the quality of the Service, we collect information provided by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service. 
This includes information such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you.

For our web analytics, we use Matomo, a privacy-focused analytics platform. Notably, our Matomo setup operates without the use of cookies. 
This means we do not store any tracking cookies on your device for analytics purposes. 
Matomo helps us understand how our Service is used, without needing to track individuals. 
It provides insights based on aggregated data, ensuring your browsing experience remains private and anonymous.

Please be aware that opting out will set a 'do not track' cookie in your browser, and if you clear your cookies, you will need to opt out again. 
This opt-out is browser-specific, so if you use multiple devices or browsers, you will need to repeat the process for each.

While our site may use cookies for other purposes (such as site functionality and preferences), these are separate from and not used in conjunction with our Matomo analytics setup.

### 2. Information Collected via Forms

When you fill out forms on our Site, you may be asked to provide your email address, name, and company.

information from anyone under the age of 13, or allow anyone under the age of 13 to sign up for the Service. In the
event that we learn that we have gathered personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without the consent of a
parent or guardian, we will delete that information as soon as possible. 

If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us at info@reduct.store.

## II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION

**Personal Information**:

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes
your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are
performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user’s
email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction
and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use
Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical support,
and inform users about promotional offers.
We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or
disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental
request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud,
security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public
as required or permitted by law.

**Non-Personal Information**:

In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also
aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy
does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose
such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.
In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a
portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that
such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to
process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time
in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We
suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.

## III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION

We are committed to the security of your personal information and employ various measures to protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.

### Technological Safeguards
Our approach to safeguarding your information includes a range of technological measures. 
These include using encryption, firewalls, and secure socket layer (SSL) technology. 
These measures are essential for the secure transmission of data over the internet and provide a defense against potential security breaches.

### Data Analytics and User Privacy
In our commitment to user privacy, we utilize Matomo for website analytics, which stores data on servers exclusively located in Europe. 
Our configuration of Matomo is cookie-less, ensuring enhanced privacy by avoiding individual user tracking. 
This setup focuses on analyzing aggregated data, allowing us to understand website usage patterns while maintaining user anonymity. 
We comply with strict data protection standards, in line with both local and international data protection regulations, to ensure the secure processing and storage of data collected through Matomo.

### Risk Acknowledgment
It's important to note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure. 
While we take all reasonable steps to ensure the protection of your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 
By using our Service, you acknowledge and agree to assume these inherent risks.

## IV. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes. When we send a promotional
communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe
instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you
indicate by unsubscribing, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to
our Privacy Policy.
